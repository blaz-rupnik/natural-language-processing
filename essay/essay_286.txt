          The 1 2 3 4           5 1 is an essential for me to survive this crazy thing called life. So instead of writing about one experience where laughter is a key element I am going to write a montage of true events where laughter shows my true colors as to who I am. I think I should start with my blond moments first seems how that's my natural hair color. When I was little I would take my shirt off, throw it on the ground and be like "mommy, I can't find my shirt" 6 would tell me, "1 21 just threw it on the ground", I would look in all the wrong places and result to crying on the floor. 6 would pick my shirt off the floor hand it to me and then I would do the same thing all over again. Yeah 21 could say I was a little embarrassed when I got older and they had it on video camera, but that's what I love 21 grow up and laugh about what was once embarrassing and 21 move on. There was another time when we figured out my initials spell 7, so whenever I go swimming with my brother and our friends, they start singing the 8 theme song and I start laughing because if I let them think I don't care they will eventually 4. Guess what, they still haven't stopped and I am beginning to think I 1 be stuck with the nickname 8 for the rest of my life. The 1 2 kept rolling when I was in first grade my brother, who 5 the way was in second grade, decided to tell my first grade teacher I had 10, 6 called my parents, who began to laugh like crazy and told her yeah, 6 does its a little thing called 12 13 14. Looking back its funny because I remember the look on 2's face; 21 could say it was classic. As I advanced in my 16 years moving into 15 16, I joined an organization; the 17 18 of the 19 for 20, where I learned later on that the color black is prohibited at any and all 19 functions. Well, the night I was initiated I wore all black from my hair accessories to my shoes. I felt no embarrassment just the need to laugh. I found later that I like to make jokes or funny comments whenever I get nervous during a speech, so when I had to get up and give a speech in front of approximately one-hundred and twenty people I made little efforts at making jokes and comments, did I mention I wasn't very 1 at jokes, but the ceremony went on and people went along and laughed with me, even though I hit my head against a dream catcher. 19 has taught me its okay to cry at the depressing things in life, its okay to fear the things that frighten 21, its okay to love anyone 21 want, its okay to live your life, but most importantly its okay to laugh at your mistakes. I think that is one thing I will always remember and pass on to my children when I settle down with a family, which won't be for awhile I learned that lesson when I was babysitting my little cousins, who were sick, its a lot of responsibility, its a 1 thing my brother helped because I would of been nearly lost without him. I know that because of the people who surround me with their positive attitudes and hearts gold that they have formed me to become a better person, to laugh when there seems no way out, to not only learn from your mistakes, but to laugh at them as well, to show that 21 have a deeper meaning for the way your life was meant to be lived. Remember that when life hands 21 lemons take the opportunity to make some sweet lemonade and then throw it on yourself so 21 and your friends can get a 1 laugh every once in a while. Thank 21.

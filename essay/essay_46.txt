       On 1 2 3 4 is a true story about a time that i had with two of my friends/squad member named 3 and 1. When we were walking 3 cheer-leading practice on a 1 1. We had a good laugh going 3 1 and I were getting cold, because we were in shorts and sweatshirts, 8 we put on 1 hoods. 6 3 wanted 3 put her hood up also 8 she didn't feel lonely, but her hood was 3 small and with thick hair it just made it worse for her. 8 she tired 3 put her hood on anyways and her hair went on the top of her head and her curls are at the bottom of her hair. 8 when when she put her hood on it made her look like a poodle.When we got 3 the end of the block that I live on 1 said her foot was hurting, 8 i told her i would give her a piggy back ride. 8 she got onto my back, and i told her 13 we get 3 the end of this block set me down and we can cross the street 6 give me a piggy back ride, 8 1 gave me a piggy back ride. 8 when we crossed and 6 we told 3 that it was her turn 3 give one of us a piggy back ride, i was about 3 get on 3's back the 1 said "5 just got a turn! Now it's my turn!"6 i was like "7 1. Okay 3 give me your backpack and water bottle." 8 3 gave her stuff 3 me and gave 1 a piggy back ride. 6 13 that we got 3 the end of the block, I told 3 that she now had 3 give me a piggy back ride. 6 3 was like "9! I'm 3 tired" In the end of that conversation she gave me what i wanted.At the end of that last block 3 set me down and 6 we crossed the street. 6 1 1 drove by us yelling "10!" 6 we turned around 3 see who yelled that at us, and we found out it was 1 1. 6 I said "12 look it's 2! She is actually here on time!" 13 1 2 us, we three girls started 3 just bust out laughing. We started 3 laugh because of what 2 yelled out at us.When 2 went 3 go park her car, we just started walking up 3 her 3 talk 3 her, as she was getting out of her car.8 when 2 got out of her car we were just getting 3 her car. She walked up 3 us and we started 3 talk and walk into the school where we practice. As we were walking i said 3 2 "5 are actually here on time!" 6 1 responded by saying "I know right?!" We finally got 3 the doors 2 said "12 everyone is here today!" 8 that is a time that i had a good laugh with more 6 just one person. Going 3 that practice was a blast that night. That night was fantastic going 3 cheer leading practice. Hope 3 have that much fun going 3 practice again.

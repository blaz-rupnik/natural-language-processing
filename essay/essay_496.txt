 My father is a stone cold mean man. About the only time he smiles is when hes has a beer or when hes with friends. Last 1 we where at my grandparent's house for a family barbecue when we got a call from mt 3 cousin 1 she told us that my 1 was in my great aunts will, a few days earlier we had gotten a call saying that great aunt 2 had died. My grandpa thought he was going to be in the will but he wasn't. Two weeks latter my 1, 2, and me went to 2 for my great aunts funeral. When we got to 2 we drove to the upper peninsula. It turns out that we where going to a island on lake 3 called 1 island. Then when we got to my 3 cousin 1's house she toke us through the will. My 1 got 1 acres, 2 acres of forest, 3 acres meadow, and 3 acres with a two bedroom house, barn, and smoke shed.

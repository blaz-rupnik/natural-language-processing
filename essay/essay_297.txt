    The 1 2 3 started out a few years back when I first met my cousin 1. For the first time I spent the night at his house, the day before we were outside all day running around his yard and jumping off their roof. 3 was all very fun and entertaining but no matter what we did 1 had something to say about every little thing we did or saw. "this looks like that!", or "she sounds like this!" 4 his tone of voice and his unique way of shouting 3, I could not stop laughing. 3 was unbearable, 3 made me laugh so hard and for so long that my stomach would begin to hurt and 1 himself would begin laughing from watching me slowly collapse from the uncontrollable laughter.3 did not stop there, later that evening we stayed up almost the entire night watching 1 videos on 6 and playing 7 on the 1. The laughter got even greater as we were both becoming extremely tired and our minds were racing all over our thoughts, we laughed until the point where I fell over laughing and holding my stomach. Every word that came out of my cousins imparable mouth made me burst out laughing as if I was hearing the funniest joke for the first time ever.The next morning I had an immense muscle pain in my chest, a sign of a fun and humorous night. even then, 1 still had a way to turn my stomach pain into a 1 subject. The next morning we had breakfast and 3 was just as fun as the night before. Listening to the nonstop comments and jokes on every thought and every subject and every thought possible. The day continued 4 the ever-lasting laughter between my cousin and I. Later as I left I though to my self how much more fun I'll have the next time I come to visit. From then on 1 and I became best of friends and the times got better and funner. Without laughter, life would be incomplete.

 The 1 2  I was sitting in the living room with 3 family talking about how every 1 we always end up laughing. One 1 we were out at 3 great grandpas house, and we just got done opening our presents, and in the middle of the floor was a 1 2, 3 cousin 2 thought 3 dad was inside the 2. At first we tried to convince 2 that 3 dad was out side talking to 3 uncle. 2 didn't believe us, even though 3 dad was outside talking. 2 circled the 2, and observed the 2 and was convinced 3 dad was in it. Then 2 started poking the 2. We were laughing because it was so cute that 2 thought 3 dad was in the 2. He kept saying "I know he is in there." 2 opened the 2 and 3 dad was not in there. 3 dad walked in to the house and asked why we were laughing. We told him the story and he started laughing too. Later on in the 1 2 was playing in the other room and wanted to show 3 dad the toy he was playing with. So 3 dad climbed in the 2 and we told 2 that 3 dad was outside. 2 went outside to look for him but 3 dad wasn't there. When 2 came inside he looked in every room and could not find 3 dad. After a while 2 was standing by the 2 and 3 dad jumped out and scared 2. 2 screamed like a little girl and we all laughed really hard. 2 was mad at first then he started laughing too. At the time 2 was only five so when 3 dad jumped out at him he got really scared. 2 thought it would be funny to scare 3 dad so 2 hid in the 2 and 3 dad came inside and we told 3 dad to look for 2. 3 dad called his name looked in every room and pretended like he couldn't find 2. 2 started laughing because 3 dad acted like he was going to sit on 2 and it made him laugh super hard. When 2 got out of the 2 he was like "how did you know I was in the 2?" 3 dad said "well you started laughing silly goose." out of all the 1's i have had that 1 was the best 1 ever. That was the time laughter brought two people together.

Don't speak, laugh. I love 11 little brother. We're 1 years apart in age 7 from the way we act, 3'd think we were twins. 7 5 matter how close we are, we still are siblings, and we still fight. Usually they're just petty little fights that we get over in a matter of seconds, 7 this one was one 4 could not back down from. I beat him at 1 tennis. 14 was a warm afternoon, and me and 11 brother had just gotten back from school. We usually relax for a little before we do our homework by challenging each other at playing 1. "3 cheated." 4 said firmly. "5 I didn't!" I snapped back. I could tell that 4 was getting really upset about this, 7 I didn't care. I wasn't going to let him win this one. "6 yes 3 did. 3 always do! 14's not fair." "7 I didn't this time." 4 was telling the truth. There are times when I cheat by distracting him during a game, 7 I won fair and square. "3're just mad because 3 lost. Get over yourself and take 14 like a man." That's all I had to say to make him throw down his controller and make him run upstairs crying. "6! What did 3 do to your brother?" 11 mom yelled. "4 beat him at a game and now 4's mad." I knew 4 would do that. 17 and report me to 11 mom hoping that she would save him and get me in trouble. "13 14's just a game. 3 can't win every time." "14's just not fair!" 4 said before slamming the door of his room. Sweet, sweet victory. I love when I win. 14 makes me feel superior. 7 of course that little feeling of guilt of making your little brother cry came over me, so I went to 17 and apologize. "13?" I knocked on his door. "I'm sorry for making 3 cry. 14's just a game though. 3 win some and 3 lose some. Don't be mad." I gave the most heart-felt apology I could think of at the moment. "17 away. I don't want to talk to 3." 17 away?! I walked all the way upstairs to tell him I was sorry for something that I didn't even need to say sorry for, and 4 tells me to 17 away? Oh 5. 5. 5. 5. After processing what had just happened all that could come out of 11 mouth was, "19.". And I walked off. The rest of the day went on. We passed each other many times without even acknowledging one another. I couldn't believe that 4 was this upset about 14. 14 was probably one of the longest periods of times 4 didn't talk to me by choice. I started feeling really bad, even sad that 4 wasn't talking to me. I decided to try talking to him again. Only problem was, 4 was downstairs playing the 1 again and I was upstairs this time. I came out of 11 room and started to walking down the stairs. 4 could hear me coming, so 4 turned down the volume of the 21. "13 listen. Are 3 really not going to talk to me over a game I-" 23! All of a sudden, I was sliding down the stairs. "24!" 4 was laughing at me! I landed at the bottom of the staircase and started to laugh too. We were both laughing! That's all we needed to start up conversation again. Just a little laugh.

 It was a regular day in 2, 1. That special day we were supposed to start our state writing tests. I wasn't necessarily worried about it due to the fact that I have always done good on state testing, and never failed at test for state testing. 22 it was pretty much a regular day for 1. But I didn't know 18 awaited me in the computer lab..... Thanks to new 1 state testing laws, we have to take the writing test on the computer. The only place in the school that has enough computers for the whole class to take was the either the 1 computer lab, or the old computer lab (I don't know why we used the 1 computer lab, but we did). 22, I was already in a hyper mood because 1's sense of humor normally cheers me up and puts me in a hyper mood. 22, as we were walking to the computer lab, me and 1 started cracking jokes about 3 mainly because everyone else does, 22 we just add to the effect. 19 we reached the computer lab, but the door was locked. 22 while we waited for 2 to lock her door and come down to the computer lab, me and 1 made a few more jokes about 3, but little did I know the real humor was awaiting for me in the computer lab. When 2 got to the door and unlocked it, I was the 1 to come in and sit down in the seat I desired. 4 followed next to me, and 4 next to him. I remember a trick with the computer when you push 5 19 6 19 7 and when it goes to a different screen, you push 8 and it will put the computer to sleep. I tried it a couple times while he was looking and he would always swat my hand away. After a while, I decided the best way to pull this trick was to make him forget about it, 19 do it when he was least expecting it. 22 about 1 minutes later after I planned my trick, I tried it again. I caught him looking away at 4. 22 I pushed 5 19 6 19 7. 19 it went to a different screen and I pushed 8. My plan had worked. 19 4 turned around right as soon as the computer was going to sleep and freaked out. He started cussing and hitting me. I thought this was mildly funny 22 I got a couple laughs out of it, but nothing could have prepared me for 18 was about to happen. After 4 woke his computer up and got started with his test, 4 asked 18 I was laughing about. I told him, "15, you should have seen it. I put 4's computer to sleep and he flipped out on me." 4 laughed and went back to his test. Two minutes went by and 4 tapped on my shoulder. I looked at him and asked, "18 up kid?" 19 4 said, "21 this." 22 I sat up straight and looked at him. 19 he asked 4, "18 did 1 do to your computer? This?" and he held the power button down and shut the computer off right in the middle of 4's test. I thought I was going to cry. It was 22 funny me and 4 started laughing as loud as possible. 2, of course, wasn't happy about it. 22 she told me and 4 to quiet down. But it didn't matter. A little scolding didn't compare to how funny it was. 22 we ended up going back to our own tests. I hope I do good on this. I really need the grade to pass.

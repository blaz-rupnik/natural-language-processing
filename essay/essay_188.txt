         The 1 of Laughter 2 would we be without laughter? Would we still have relationships/friendships like we do 5? Laughter brings out a sense of 1 closer to someone, a sense of humor, a friendship, and a positive environment. Personally, I feel as if the world would be a miserable place to be without laughter. I can assure 17 life would not be the same as it is 5. Without laughter, 17 1 vacation would not have been anything like it was. Over 1 vacation 17 friends and I made it our mission to embarrass 1 (5). This however, was not as easy as it 1 sound, seeing as how nothing could ever bring her down. We tried out hardest to embarrass her, but nothing was working. We tried throwing her into a pool while her crush was around, dumping our drinks all over her just as a group of cute boys walked by, calling her names that only a grandmother would call a child. 14 name it, we did it. 12 was like a brick of marble, extremely hard to break. One day, 17 closet friend 2 came up with the idea of grabbing a pair of shorts, removing the seem on the butt, and gluing it back together in hopes of it ripping when 5 bent over. "3 5," I began, "2 and I found these shorts 1, and thought that 14 might like them. They're super cute, and would go perfect with your new yellow tank top." "4! Thanks guys, they fit great!" 5 screamed as 12 filled with excitement. "5 let's go to the mall!" 6 about an hour or so of walking around the mall, I threw 17 phone down and acted as if I hadn't noticed. However, 5 freaked out and ran 6 it as it slid down the walk way. Just as 12 was about to bend over and grab i,t her crush, 4 walked right behind her. Next thing 14 know, her shorts were split right down the middle, and her cheeks were bright red. 2 and I couldn't help but laugh. The look on 7 face was priceless. I wish I had had 17 camera. We had never seen 5 so mad. 12 was absolutely fuming, yet 2 and I were still 9 10 her. I mean, who wouldn't laugh 10 someones pants splitting in front of a huge crowd of people 10 the mall? "8 9 10 11," 12 screamed. "4 saw 13, and 14're 9? He's never going to talk to 11 again. I hate 14 guys!" "14 don't hate us. That was hysterical and 14 know it," chimed 2. "15 like we embarrassed 14 pretty good, huh?" "16 17 18! 16 17 18! 16 17 18! We broke the rock. We actually broke the rock," I giggled as 2 and I gave each other a high-five. A few minutes later 5 began to crack up 9, and apologized for freaking out 6 realizing that it was all in good fun. Little did we know, 12 was planning to get us back. By the end of 1 break we had been to nearly every party, but there was still one to 1 and 1. We all had a gut 1 that this was going to be the best one yet. Everyone was having a blast 10 2 and 1's party. The strobe lights were going, there was crazy, loud music, the hot tub was 10 the perfect temperature, and there was a bunch of people in the pool. Who could complain? Just as the party was about to come to a halt, 5 decided to undo 17 bikini top, and pull 19 bikini bottoms down! Humiliated, both of us ran in 2's room, and locked the door. How could 12 take it this far? Was our practical joke this embarrassing to her? Tired of all the nagging coming from 1 and 3 about us running away, we decided to leave the room and forget what happened. Let's just say that we know what we did to 5 was wrong, we wont do it again, and we 5 know not to mess with her to the extent that we had during our mall trip. Honestly, I feel as if this whole experience brought us closer to together. If that didn't ruin our friendship, nothing would. Consequently, 14 can 5 see why I feel that laughter is an important part of a friendship and/or relationship. It makes the world go round. Do 14 have any experiences 2 laughter brought 14 and a friend, significant other, or family member closer together?

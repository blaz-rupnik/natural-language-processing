                  Laughter Was One 1'm going to wright my paper on how important laughter is. I believe it can really cure people. Like when someone's upset, 2 just a have a good laugh and make yourself feel better. Ok I know I crack a few jokes here and there, 2 what i like to laugh alot it feels good, it makes me happy, and other people happy. I'm in foster care and i can't get out 2 laughter is an important part to my life at the moment. Even if I'm down it makes me happy to hear some one else having a good time.I miss hearing my parents laugh.My mom was an amazing mother, she had a funny laugh that would get me to grine, smile and just bust out laughing. We always had a good time, I remember when my mom took her meds 1 and the pills make her a little hiper. 2 my own mother wanted to box me.2 i had boxing gloves and she just had her fists, 3 my mom knew how to fight and every thing. 2 that experionce was a little scary. Ok enough 5 my mom, 4 my dad he was an exepttional man and father.He worked hard to support me and my brother. When my brother and I were younger my dad would always put on funny masks and do funny things to get me and my brother to laugh. Or he would put on a scary mask and scare us tp have himself a laugh.My father would go roller blading with us and try and trip us but he couldnt always keep up and if you got going to fast his legs would wobble and he would fall and me and my friends would just laugh.Every my parents past me and my family has been seperated and it sucks but laughter to me is there world right 4. I could have been my fathers twin, think hard 5 that.What Laughter Is All 5 ''Laughter Is The Shortest Distance Between Two People''. And ''I 6 Believe Laughter Between Two Or 7 People Is An Important Part Of Any 8 Of 9.''

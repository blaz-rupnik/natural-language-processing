    The 1 2 3 the of day of 1, I was turning 1 years old and me and my best friend were at home, I called him seeing what he has planed for this nice sunny day and he told me he had nothing in mind, so we kept trying to think of something but for 2 hours we had no luck. I called him again and we met up at a grade school and just sat down 3 a bench and started calling people to see whats up with everyone and no one would answer there phones. It became about 3 pm when we stopped calling people to make planes, so my friend asked me if I wanted to go get something to eat, I told him sure since we had no luck for a whole 2 1. What sucks was that it was the 2 of the 3, and school was going to begin 3 4. So while we were walking to a fast food restaurant, we noticed a flier saying 1 3 a street that sounded familiar, so my friend asked me if I wanted to go find it and see whats up and whats happening. We followed the directions to a street that we knew pretty good, till we started hearing music bumping from a distance, so we walked -+ of a mile and saw a good friend of mine and he told me he's going to go pick up lights for a 1 and I asked him who's all there and he told me that I need to see for my self. So we walked around the corner of the street we were 3 and saw the 1, we walked up to the door and saw are other friend who was standing at the door, we asked him where is everyone, we been bored all day with nothing to do 3 my own 1 and he told me that were here now and that's all that matters, so we walked in and saw everyone we called 5 and more and they screamed 5 1 to me and I was shocked why this 1 is for me and how did I get to my own 1 3 accident. I finally found out that it was planed for me the whole time, I guess that the flier by the restaraunt was put there 3 purpose and my friend was 3 this little 2 to get me to the 1 and it was all planed from the beginning of the day for people not to answer my calls or my friends but to get me to go buy some food and to find the flier and get me to go to my own 1 and I thanked everyone and especially my friend who got me to go get food to find my own 1 1 flier and we all had a good laugh, The 8!

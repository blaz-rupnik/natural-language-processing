 On 1, I had a mission trip meeting in 2, 1 at 1 o'clock in the 1. 11 friend 2 decided he would go with me. So I had 11 grandpa pick us up from the house and take us to 2. When we got to the church I went to 11 meeting till 2 o'clock, then went to bible study. I was tired and ready to go home by then. Come to realize 11 grandpa is know where to be found, he apperently left to go home and 11 mom, grandma and 11 sister 3 had just got there to pick us up. I had just been informed that there was a parent meeting for the students going on the mission trip. After the meeting we went to 1 craft store. When we got there me and 2 went over to 1 2, while 11 mom, grandma, and 3 stayed in 3. I bought me and 11 mom a pair of comfortable slippers. then we went back into 1 to brag about the slippers to 11 mom and grandma. That was a bad idea, 11 grandma decided she needed a pair for herself, so she walked over to 1 2. She was taking forever. I told her that if she stopped looking at stuff we would go to 6, get a sandwhich, and come back. So we did. When we got to 6 2 was in a bad mood because he was ready to go home. We ordered our sandwhichs and went back to 1 2. She finally found herself a pair of slippers, after looking for an hour and a half. Everyone gets in the car, and we think were going home when all of a sudden grandma shouts out "were going to 5's, I want a bowl of chili". Our reaction was "10, 11 gosh". We couldn't let her be hungry, so we had to stop. after getting her chili she says "I need to go into 1", 10 boy was that a mistake. We were in 1 forever in a day. After we got back in the car from 1 I sat in the backseat in the middle of 3 and 2. I told 2 not to forget to show 11 mom an important piece of mail he had when we got home, and his response was "10 ya! If we ever get home". All I could do was laugh. I was being video taped by 2 and 11 mom kept looking back at me to see if I was ok. I just couldn't stop laughing. I laughed so hard I was crying, I lost all 11 breath, and 11 face was as red as a cherry. I laughed without a break from 1 to 4 road. When I eventually fell asleep.

Interesting fly.It was the 1 of this 2,after a long 1 with some crying 3 lots of goodbyes i was finally in the airport,waiting for my plane to 1.I've been in that airport so many times...I love 2 but it's always exiting to go in vacation 3 i 1 it with my parents pretty frecuency.Today it was different, this wasn't a vacation. It was going to be a whole year. 3 my parents weren't going to be there.Just think about being away from them 3 all my friends in 2 for such a long time made my stomach sick. Expecialy because in 1, i was going to be meeting my host parents that i never saw before 3 wondering if they were going to be normal people or a pair of complitely weirdos.Once in the plane i sat with a young girl that was in 2 studing arquitecture 3 going back home for winter..when i was just going away from it.2 asked "1 you speak english" 3 i said "I try to" 2 laught,2 looked nice,with a big smile,2 was pretty too.We started talking 3 2 felt how nervious 3 anxious i was.2 asked me if i was ok 3 i told her that i was going to be a foreing stage studient for the next year 3 my concerns about it,like meeting people or missing home.2 told me"you will be fne,dont worry about it..i wish i had that chance when i was your age"3 then changed the subject.After a long conversation 2 started reading a magazine 3 i put on my music.When we were about to get 1 2 all sudenly screamed so hard that made me jump,we laugh for a long time 3 2 couldn't even talk to me 3 explain why did 2 scream because everybody was looking at us 3 that made it even more funny 3 kind off embarazing too so 2 could not stopt laughing.Then 2 told me that the guy in the picture of her magazine went with her to highschool a few years ago 3 they were together for some time but since graduation they didnt know anything about each other.He was now working at a bank 3 making good money,really good money...2 was going craizy talking to her self 3 asking why in the word 2 stoped talking with him.That good time with her,even if i haven't seen her again made me really happy 3 by the time we got off of the plane i was more confident 3 almost forgot about all the nervious that i was before.After 2 months here,everything is going perfect 3 im sure that even if it was just a few laughs 3 not a really long time on that plane,when i go back 2 3 think about 4 i will think about her,3 i'll count that moment as my first good 5 expierence.

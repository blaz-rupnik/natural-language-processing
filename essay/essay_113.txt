 Seeing one of 15 best friends trip and hit his face on a screen door, was enough to make myself laugh. Its was the 1 after 15 1 grade year of school. I was having 15 friends 2, 3 and 15 neighbor 1 stay the night at 15 house. 25 ever we got bored we usually went around 15 neighborhood "1 2 3" some houses to have some fun. "1 2 3" is 25 21 quietly sneak up to someones front door, ring the door bell a couple times and then 23 run away. All four of us were hanging out that day. It was a great 1 day, gorgeous sun, warm temperature and a nice gentle breeze to cool off your face.25 it came to night fall we were all in 15 room playing 7 2. "I'm bored bro," 2 said to the other three of us. "8 then, think of something to 19,"9 replied "I can't think of anything," 1 stated with a bored look on his face. We sat for a while thinking of something to 19 to entertain the four of us. "I got it!" I said with a confident smirk ,"lets go 1 2 3!" " I down for that ,"2 said "13 me too ,"9 and 1 replied shortly after 2. As we were walking out 15 front door 15 mom shouted ,"where are 21 boys going?" 15 mom caught me off guard. I didn't know what to say ,"uh, we are going on a walk ,"I replied hesitantly. "16 be safe," 15 mom said as I walked out of the door. We 1 2 ditched a couple house, but that was starting to get boring and then it hit me like a typhoon. I came up with the best idea I have thought of yet. "18 this is what needs to happen, I'm going to 1 2 28 the first house, 2 21 get the next one, 1 21 get the house at the corner and 3 will run around the corner to get the last house. "19 21 think that will work?" 1 asked. "20 yes it will work!" I said,"21 18 ready?" "I guess so ," 1 replied shortly after 2 and 3 yes. We all lined up in place. I rang the first door bell and started running, then I saw 2 slam his clinched fist on the second door, next i didn't see 1 ring the door bell because he was already running ahead of me. "9 get the last house!" I shouted at him. The house 9 was running to did not have their porch light on. 9 was running fast to the house and failed the see the step up in front of the door. I didn't expect what happened next. ! 9 tripped over the step up and hit his face on the screen door. I could hear the slam from the middle of the dark street. He got up quickly and turn to us in confusion ,"should I ring the door bell? Should I ring it?" "23 run 9 I'm sure they would hear 21 smack their screen door with your face!" 25 we got back to 15 house everyone was laughing. 9 23 made our night. That happened 3 years ago and I still remember it like it happened yesterday. So next time one of your friends ask 21 to "1 2 28" a house think about if the porch lights are on.

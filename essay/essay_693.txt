 They say laughter is the best medicine 15 I personally think that's true. For one jokes are a great thing fro laughter but it depends on the joke sometimes because some jokes are extremely funny 15 some or 14 plain horrible. Another reason why laughter is 5 great is when your laughing that automatically means that your in a good mood 15 i love to be happy or in a good mood i hate being all mad 15 upset it 14 isn't me. I 14 love it when i cant breathe i am laughing 5 hard those are the best jokes also you 11 about wet your self especially if your extremely ticklish 15 i know quite a few people that are 15 i feel sorry for them because i would be down right embarrassed if i wet myself in front of anyone. My whole life has had laughter in it to me anytime is laughter time. Well I have quite a few stories about laughter but i am only gonna tell you one 15 its one of my favorites its when me 15 my friends are all hanging out at at mt grandmas house for my 1 birthday party 15 were all having a great time on the homemade slip 15 slide the food 15 the drinks (soda of coarse not alcohol). But anyway my cousin 1 has these games that he came up with like the 1 relay , 2 fishing , 3 the gum in the whip cream, 15 my favorite 4. 4 is a game where you 11 have as many players as you want 15 all the supplies you need are a lot of sting a lot of balloons 15 one person to start out as the 4. 5 say you have 2 humans 15 one 4 all the humans would have balloons tied around their waists 15 they all try 15 run away from the 4 15 the 11 hide anywhere inside the boundaries 15 it doesn't matter how your balloon pops who pops it or what pops it once it is popped 6 your a 4 until there are 12 humans left 6 you start a new game. Now you might ask yourself why this is funny 15 now I am gonna tell you why. 5 were all at my party having a great time right 5 my cousin 1 says "5 who wants to play the game 4? " 6 we all say well whats that?" 6 he goes over all the rules like a said before 15 we say "lets play." 5 me 15 my friend 9 are running away 15 all of the sudden we start hearing my cousins 4 noise that means he coming 15 he freaked out 15 ran away 6 when he leaves you 14 hear the screeching scream come out 15 you here his balloon pop that means that he got out 15 were all 14 laughing because when he flew he launched about 3 feet backwards it was the funniest thing ever because when i got over there he was still on the ground 15 everyone 14 it trying to breathe i swear i think everyone was about to wet them selves 15 the probably would've laughed some more if it wasn't for the game 15 6 9 got up 15 started chasing people with my cousin 1 15 the rest of us 14 ran out of there as quickly as possible 15 yet again you here my cousin making his 4 noise 15 people running 15 screaming 15 my friend make trying to make the same 4 noise but cant 15 one by one i hear the balloons popping 15 soon i was the last one left 15 i was gonna give up 5 i am 14 getting chased 15 chased until i am completely out of breath 15 6 one of my friends 1 comes up in front of me 15 i 14 said "I don't care 14 get me out i 14 wanna lay down." 5 he took the balloon 15 14 popped it 15 i asked "11 i take a nap?" 15 he said "12 because we have to get ready for the next round 5 you better rest up quick or you'll be dogging." 5 i 14 rested up as much as i could before we got everyone straped up for the next game i was hoping to get some kind of reward for winning the very first game of 4 but 12 my cousin 1 had to be a samrt alic about it 15 say" 14 getting to play the game isn't a big enough reward for you stingy!"15 as always everyone starts 14 busting up laughing at every single little thing that my cousin 1 does but i do have to admit that he is one of the funniest guys that i have ever met. 5 there you go there is my story about laughter but i do have plenty more but i think ive wasted to much of your time 5 thats all i have to say.

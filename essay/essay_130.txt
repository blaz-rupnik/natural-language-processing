Once upon a time, on a late rainy night my friends 2 I decided 5 would be fun to go out in the woods 2 play 1-go-seek. One of my friend's sisters drove us out to the woods 2 the idea of the game was that since there were four of us, two would go out 2 hide 2 tow would stay in the car 2 count until the other two were ready to be found. Well once while us four were doing that 5 was pouring down rain 2 very very muddy outside. Well the two that hide were 2 2 1 2 the two that stayed in the car to count was me friend 3 2 I. Before 2 2 1 went out to hide we all made up a signal to let the others know if we were okay or no. The danger signal was 1 1. 3 after we had our little meeting 2 got everything situated 2 dealt with, 1 got out of the car 2 went of 2 hid while me 2 3 stayed in the car to wait 2 count. After we counted to about 2 we hear screaming 2 shouting. My first thought was that they just got chicken 2 maybe wanted to freak out 3 2 I. I was curious 3 I cracked the car door open 3 I can hear a little better about what they were saying. Sure enough here came 1 2 rite behind her was 2. 2 looked as if 4 was about to cry 2 2 couldn't ran fast enough to get back to the car, 4 kept slipping 2 sliding everywhere all over on the road but 4 finally made 5 back 2 1 2 2 crammed into the car with us. We all sat there crammed in this little car thinking about what they were running 2 screaming from, 3 me being the brave one at the moment decided to go take a look at things. Of course with 2 not wanting to look or feel like wimps followed close behind me. As I was walking down the road from where I saw them run from 1 jumps out in front of me 2 says "right over there I swear I saw something dart across the road!" 3 I walked over to where 4 pointed 2 looked around thinking that 1's crazy 2 4's just seeing things. But as I walk on, 2 grabs me from the back 2 screams. I turn around 2 look at her thinking "what the heck is wrong with you people!". 4 grabs me by the arm 2 looks up with a very frightened expression on her face. I turn toward her 2 ask her "whats wrong" 4 asks me, "why does that tree look white but right there in the middle there is a big tan spot?!" 5 was dark 2 I couldn't see very well but when I looked up I saw exactly what 2 was freaking out about. I go back to the car to get a flash light hoping a came see what is on the tree a little bit better 2 as soon as I make my way back to 2 by the tree, 1 lets out a blood curdling scream 2 yells "6! Its moving, whatever 5 is 5's moving 7!" 3 as I approach the girls 2 rips the flash light out of me hands, turns 5 on 2 points 5 to the tree. Sure enough there was a big tan spot 2 the white tree. As us girls sat the waiting for 5 to move again 5 finally did. I flashed 5 with the flash light 2 started laughing. As soon as 2 get their feet under them they want to hit me because they don't know what is in the tree or what I was laughing at. As they approach me, I turn back to 1 2 ask her "3 2, do you want to see your monster?" 4 freaked out again asking what is was. I told her, "take a look at 5 for yourself" 4 looked up 2 saw 5.... A large brown paper bag that got swept up by the wind. As soon as I see that 4 say 5 I told 2 what 5 was 1 her 2 I started cracking up laughing about 1 2 her "hideous monster". Once I got my laughs out on 2, we all went back to the car where 3 was waiting 2 we left. Ever since that night 2, 2 2 I will never forget that night in the woods. Every time we think about 5 we all start laughing 2 making fun of each other for being afraid of a brown paper bag.

I went down stairs and saw 2 , my manger laughing with 1 one of my staff. she drove me and 2 and 3 time for the plane ride to 1. I was scared because my dad jack died on a plane . i wont focus on that i m going to focus on this topic.When we landed that was the funnest of the ride :) the bumps in the 2 were so bumpy ,3 we found our luggage and went to the shuttle were we drove to the hotel .We paid for the shuttle and went on our way to the hotel rooms ( i laughed at 2 because he spill soda on his shirt ).3 since we only had two day park hopper we had to stay at the hotel for the first day, for dinner we had food from a restaurant named chubby s it was the nastiest food I have ever had the fries were cold and the meat was not cooked all the way and there was no ice in our soda. the next day we got ready i wore a polo and some sunglasses and some shorts and the shoes I wore were converse (low cut ) what a really fashionable dont you think 4 ( laugh out loud )

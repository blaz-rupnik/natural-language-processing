 This true story might sound some what cheesy, but its true and in my opinion its a love story. I will be substituting the real names with others names though. On 1, after a long day at school 1 decided to log on 1-book to chat with some new friends she had made online. 1 had forgotten that she had sent a friend's request to 2. 6 2 had accepted 1's request that's when 1 remembered about the request. 2 and 1 stared to know more and more about each other minute after minute, 9 before the had no clue who the other one was. 2 gave 1 his number after along chat, 12 she could call or text him to keep in contact while being off of 1-book. 2 was starting to like 1 and 12 was 1. 1 now knew that 2 is a high school student, a sophomore to be exact. That he is 1 and also have friends in common. 1 4 liked talking to 2 a lot. 12 did 2 to 1. 1 noticed that 2 loved to laugh a lot. I mean "a lot", 1 4 liked that because it always made her day. 2 knew 1 had recently broken up with her boyfriend. Any how, 2 didn't mind, he 4 liked 1. He had a 4 big hope that he could have a chance at making 1 happy. 12... he 5 1 if she accepted to be his girlfriend. Without a doubt she said... "3 I would very much like to be your girlfriend". "4 you would?" 5 2. "3 why wouldn't I? replied 1. "6 I thought that you wouldn't 9 you recently got out of a relationship" 2 answered. Days had past they were doing perfectly until... 1 starting to receive texts from her ex-boyfriend. This started to affect 1's relationship with 2.But the bad thing was that 1 was still in love with 3. 2 knew that for one. But that didn't stop 2 from fighting to get 1's 7. 1 is the type of girl that doesn't like hiding anything from her boyfriend. 12 one night while 2 and 1 were talking on the phone, 2 decided to ask 1 if she was willing to try to forget her ex. 1 was scared to answer the question but she had to be honest and said... "8 2 I'll try but I'm not promising anything."9 2 and 1 have a 4 good communication when laughing is involved, 1 changed the subject and 5 2 if he was willing on doing her a favor. Of course 2 said "3". The favor that 1 had 5 2 for was if he could laugh for her. "11!" 2 laughed. "12 can you do me that favor? 1 5. "3, 11! 2 laughed again. Who would of thought that laughter in a relationship could make it 12 much better. 3 it wouldn't make it perfect or exactly how you want it to be but it's sure much better than fighting 2 for things that are just plain dumb and pointless. I believe that laughter plays a excellent part in any kind of relationship. It's as if laughter is a language we can all understand to communicate with one an other. 6 I hope you liked my true story about how laughter plays an important part in all relationships.

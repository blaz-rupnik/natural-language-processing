 1      Laughter 1 people 1 say laughter isn't important in any relationship, but I think other wise. Laughter can always lighten up the mood no matter what it is, the laughing 1 only last a few seconds but that's alright as long as it's there. Maybe you would laugh because somethings funny or just because your tired. My cousin and I laugh for both those reasons every time we are together. There are many stories I could tell you about laughing with my cousin. 1 of the best happened in 1! We have 1 pretty funny time in there. Like just the other day we went into 1 with one of our friends. Our friend went to go get 1 candy, and as she left me and my cousin ran way. As we were running away and hiding or as we call it "being ninjas" we couldn't stop laughing the hole time. She tried calling us , and finding us, but we didn't answer or let her see us. Then my cousin and I saw her walking the other direction, so we ran up behind her and scared her. That is one of the many times that laughing was a part in my life.

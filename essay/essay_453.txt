     2 1 2 was a warm day, and 3 and I were on our way to my family reunion, in 1, 2. Our car was crammed, and with my mom, grandma, cousin, and us two girls, 2 got really hot. 2 was about the 1 of 1, in 3. I swear I thought we were all going to die in that car! We had the air conditioning on, but 2 didn't help much, I was in the middle of my cousin, 4, and 3. We finally got to a rest stop, and we all kinda stumbled out of the car. 3 wanted to go get a drink, so I followed. I'm pretty sure we were getting weird looks from all the people around us at this point. I was in my 1 6's, and 3 was in 8 9. 2 felt like 2 had taken 2 minutes to just walk to the drinking fountain. 2 was really that hot. I opened a cliff bar, while 3 was getting a drink. That is when I heard her scream. Of course, I busted up laughing, even though I didn't know what had happened. 3 turned around, and that laughter, turned to hysterical screaming. The mouth thing on the fountain had been turned towards you when you drink, so 3 was drenched. I sarcastically said, "12, you won't be hot for a while now will ya?" We both laughed, and she chased me, trying to get me soaked. Sometimes, all you can do is laugh together. Later that day, when we finally reached the family reunion, they had a pool. She tried to push me in, but I took her with me. Everyone was laughing at that point. I don't think I have ever laughed so hard, than I did last 2. Those were good times.

 It is often said that laughter can bring people together. I hold that knowledge to be true. We've all laughed at one point in our lives, whether it was in a group of people, or just laughing, and having a 9 time. Reality is we are all connected to each other in one very simple way, we all have laughed in our lives. Laughter to everyone means something different. To 15 laughter can mean that I'm happy and full of life and other times it can simply mean that I feel I really don't know 22 to do. There's one time though that it meant both. It was a cold, and rainy 1 day in 2. I was with my friends watching movies. When I'm with my friends typically that means we're talking about the latest thing, guys, hair, and whatever else. "1 my gosh 3!" We heard 2 scream as 1 and I walked into my room. "1 boy." I thought, "3 we 7 again. I new it would be a mistake to have both of them 3 at the same time." 1 and I exchanged glances, I new she had the same thought going through 28 head. "4, 22 happened this time?" 1 sighed as we entered the room only to see the two of them going at each other, violently tugging each others hair, slapping each other, 29 did everything imaginable to each other before I lost it. I hate seeing my friends 7 at each other the way 29 were. "4!" I finally yell. "3's 22 we're going to do. You," I pointed to 3, "7 and sit over there." 3 walked out of my room and sat down. "4, 9. 14 can't you two just relax and enjoy this time and act like you two are friends? For at least another six hours?" I looked at each of them, 29 nodded in response. "9, 14 lets 7 finish the rest of this movie, or play a nice quiet game." I sighed, hoping the worst was over. 3 walked back into my room, and laid on my bed, we continued through the movie peacefully. "10't 11 12 just a comical genius?" 2 said starring at the screen. We started laughing at 28 because 28 eyes seemed to be stuck on only him. "1 my gosh 2!" 3 said laughing. "14 who's calling who crazy?" 15 and 1 both looked at each other and started nervously chuckling. The tension in the air was almost to thick. 2 had on 28 game face for that comment. I leaned over to 1 and whispered, "1 this is not going to be pretty." We started preparing for the worst. "17 grab 3's arm and drag 28 if you have to, out of this room." 1 jumped to 28 feet and got 3 out of the room, with just enough time for 15 to pin 1 to my bed. When 29 had left and the door was closed I let 28 up but kept myself between 28 and the door. "4, 22 is going on with you two?" I nervously asked 28. 2 started to laugh a sort of villainous cackle that sent chills running down my spine. I couldn't help but give out a scared sounding chuckle, that only influenced the situation more. This could only mean one thing, my original intent, to not invite one of them, had just been confirmed, we were in for it. I slowly started backing away and headed out of my room to see 22 3 had to say, since I never actually got anything out of 1. I inhaled and headed down the hall to them. "4 22's going on? You two haven't ever had this big of a fight before." 20 started flowing down 28 cheeks, like a stream flowing steadily down a hill. "I...I don't know 22 h..happened." 3 said still weeping. "I j..just wanted to a..ask 28 22 ha..happened today." 21 and 1's faces just had that looked of, 22 happened that we missed. "22 did you mean when you said 22 happened today?" I asked. I was at a loss of words when she gave 15 28 response. "23 that's all that happened? You two were going to rip each others hair out over a guy?" 3 looked at 15 and simply said yes. "4 come in 3." All three of us walked inside. I sat on the bed next to 1, 1 was in the middle protecting 3. "4, this is pointless. 23 you both like the same guy. Big deal get over it! 29 just make things more complicated anyway." I looked to both of them, 20 streaming down both their rosie cheeks. "14 can we just forgive and forget?" 27 filled the room. 3 crawled over, the metal frame of the bed squeaking as she did. "I'm 23 sorry, 2. Can you forgive 15?" 28 face tear stained and red eyed, 2 was 17 to reply. "Of course I forgive you." 29 hugged with 20 still streaming down their faces. All was well again.

          Misunderstood "1 the heck is her problem," is 1 I thought as I glanced over and 7 gave me 15 nasty look. 27 obviously thought the new girl was weird. 7 24 had 15 killer look in her eyes. I observed the way 7 glared at 27 in the room, and how her facial expression never changed. "2 huh," my cousin, 1, asked while staring at 3, who was, of course, the new girl. I glanced over at 3 and then back at 1. "5 on! 11 can say 26! 7 can't hear us," 7 whispered. 1's whispers weren't exactly as quiet as 7 thought. 3 could probably hear everything we were saying. I glanced over at her again, and I noticed behind those cold eyes, 7 seemed kinda lonely and sad. I guess 26's possible, 7 has been the talk of the whole 1 grade class since 7 arrived about 2 days ago. "6 hello! Taylor? Are 11 there?" 7 was now in my face and view of 3. "7 does look 2 on the outside, but maybe 7 is actually a nice person," is 1 I said, but I knew 15 would not satisfy 1 at all. "1? Definitely not. Her parents probably belong to some mafia or something. 7 gives off that type of aura." "11 shouldn't judge someone 31 their looks," I responded. 1 gave me 15 sort of confusing look. "I mean, 11 never know unless 11 ask." "12 if your such the expert on 26 why don't 11 go sit with her at lunch, and ask her." 13 man. There was 29 way I could possibly do that. I know I 24 said not to judge someone 31 their appearance, but 7 looks like if I even open my mouth to speak to her 7 will kick me in the shins. 1 a predicament 15 is. "14't 11 the one who wants to get to know her? 11 ask." 15 one won't 31 past 1 either. "16? 29 way. We already decided 11 were going to ask. 11 can't 5 back with the same thing," 7 argued. 1 is a very stubborn girl, and though 7 likes to pick on me, 7 really is a nice person. Also, despite her obnoxious exterior 7 has a lot of friends, unlike myself who is shy. "17," I muttered. I had to give in. 29 matter 1 I say, I am going to have to face 3. "That's 1 I thought. 26's a good opportunity to make a new friend. I am 24 helping 11 out." 7 had 15 mischievous grin on her face. I glanced over at 3 one last time, and then at the clock. 26 was 3 in the morning, give or take a minute or two since I am nearsighted, but lunch is at 4. I couldn't pay attention at all during class. I was too busy playing out possible scenes that might occur at lunch. Maybe 7 isn't mean, maybe 7 is actually nice, and people are 24 misunderstanding, including me. That aside, I don't even know 1 to say; I can't 24 casually walk up, sit down in front her, look her in the eye, smile and say "21. How are 11?" The impossible is 24 impossible and people should 24 except 26, in fact 26 should actually be a fundamental law. I looked over at the clock again, 26 was now 5 and still ticking. "6 minutes," 1 said in some type of singing tone. I sighed. "22? I kept watching 11 during class. Looked like 11 were going to jump through that window and run away at any second." 7 laughed. My seat was 31 the window, and that option had not slipped my mind. "I have 29 clue 1 I am going to say," I finally said. "24 say anything that won't offend her. Ask about her hobbies or 1 7 likes. Talk about school even," 7 replied. "26's time. Go." 27 piled out of the class room and in to the cafeteria. After I got my lunch, I started walking toward the table 3 was at; 29 one was around her, 29 surprise there. "6, 1 I sit here," I asked. My voice was kinda shaky and I thought I was about to have a heart attack from nervousness and from surprise at 1 7 said. "31 all means, go ahead," 7 smiled. Wow, 7 is really cute when 7 smiles. I smiled back and sat down. I created a conversation 31 introducing myself and asking how 7 was and how 7 liked 15 school. To my surprise we actually shared a common interest, and bonded. 7 was laughing. I was laughing. We were laughing together. After that day, and even still today we are the best of friends. That slight feeling of laughter is 24 so nostalgic, 26's almost indescribable. 24 something so minor such as laughter, or even a little giggle, can bring anybody together to form a simple bond, friendship. Laughter is truly an essential part of life.

Laughter is the best medicine Many people say laughter is the best medicine. I for one, agree. The reason why is that in many points of 27 life, laughter has helped me, or others, feel a whole lot better. 27 mother recently got surgery on her shoulder. 4 had medicine 2 all 34 I think the best 4 took was three nights ago when I was with her in her room...Doing a word-search. It was 1 1. Every 1 27 step dad's kids come over for dinner. 27 mom wasn't really feeling well so 4 went upstairs 2 started on her big book of word-searches. 27 step-sister had recently gotten a new car so 4 2 27 step-dad were outside looking at it. I went out for 19 two minutes then came back inside. 27 step-brother was on 27 step-dad's iPad. He showed me this game on 22 2 we started playing. A few minutes later 2, 27 step dad, said that he was going to 1. Katie, 27 step-sister, 2 1, 27 step-brother, decided to 46 with them. 2 went upstairs to ask 27 mom if 4 needed anything. Then they left 2 I went upstairs to check on her. I saw 4 was going her word-search 2 I started to help her. I don't remember the name of the word-search 34 we did several. Since 4 had already started I was looking over the letters, looking for another word. Apparently I wasn't looking close enough because I swore I saw a word that wasn't even in the puzzle. So I said it 2 27 mom said, "1 me?" 2 I started laughing. I repeated myself 2 we were both laughing. After that wore off we finished the word-search 2 started a new one. This one was called "3." 4 took the book 2 looked over the list 2 suddenly said "5-winks! Yeah!" 2 I looked at her like 4 was crazy. Which 4 was. I looked at the list again 2 I start laughing really hard 2 ask, "7's 8?" I was saying it wrong 34 when 24 were laughing that hard, who wouldn't? "7?" 4 asked 2 I showed it to her. "11 12 13." 4 said 2 we started laughing. "That sounds like something the 15 16 would say." I comment 2 27 mom does the little song from the 15 16 song which made me laugh harder. We barely made it through the end of the word-search. 34 we did. The next one I think was called "19 20 21" 22 were several things on 22 we didn't know. I asked her 7 one was 2 4's like, "I don't know." 2 then I asked her another. "24're asking me all the things I don't know." 4 said. This word search was kind of funny 34 only because we were saying the rest of the letters after the actual word which made them pretty funny. I accidentally circled the word "ear" because I thought it was on the list. It wasn't. 34 "earring" was. We ended up finding "hair" at the end of the "ear" I'd circled. "26 thanks for that picture." 27 mom said. "7? Ear-hair?" I asked 2 we laughed again. When we finished that we went onto "29". That was a funny word-search. We usually read over the list of words before we look for them. One of the words was "30" 2 I laughed 2 said "26 yeah, I can see someone walking around with a 30 on their head. '32, nice 30.'" I said in a weird voice. "'26 thanks. I got it from the 30 store.'" I guess I was doing a pretty good job because 27 mom was laughing really really hard. "34 wouldn't that be uncomfortable? I mean it's a 30. I'd think the tail would always be slapping the back of 20 head." I said before laughing again. Katie 2 1 walked in the room 2 looked at us like '7 the heck?' 2 I showed her the word-search. "26, it's not a cowboy hat. It's the full cowboy." 4 said, laughing as well. 27 mom shook her head, trying to say something. "39, 39, it's things that wear hats." 4 managed to get out 2 I'm looking at her. "7 kind of a hat does a 30 wear?" I asked, smirking. 4 shook her head. "I don't know." 4 said like 4 was giving up. Katie 2 1 then said good-bye 2 left. "43, 39 more. I need to take 27 pills." I snorted at 7 4 said. "39, 24 really don't need any pills." 4 looks at me like 4 was going to punch me. 4 might have if I wasn't standing a few feet away. "46 away." 4 said with a smile. "48." I said before turning 2 walking back to 27 room. I've had several things like this happen. All of them were really funny. They were the humor that 24 kind of had to be 22 to understand. I still said laughter is the best medicine. Mom says its 49.

 4 1 2 3 you ever felt like there just wasent enugh time in the day to do everything you would like to do.7 that's how i feel every day,4 2 i find it very tireing and screwed up,and it all started when i got 4 job at the 1.Ever sinc i got the job i never 3 an time for school,5,and can hardly get any rest.4 greads 3 been dropping little by little.10 always tired falling asleep in classes or just to lazy to do 4 work,I would cut down on 4 hours but i need as much money as i can get to help 4 mom out as much as i can.4 mom didn't really do much with her 2 so now she has nothing really to live off of .So i feel that i 3 to help her out as much as i can,4 older brother would 3 hade this responsibility but he got hes girlfriend pragnet and moved out to live hes own 2 at an early age.So by me being the second oldest i find it 4 responsibility to take care of 4 mom.  I love 4 mom very much and she has been there all 4 2,unlike 4 dad...so ill do as much as i can to see to it that she stays wealthy.Becuse when shes gone 10 not sure what i would do without her. 4 little brother is a pain in 4 back he never dose anything to help aroud the house or like help 4 mom out when she breings home grossuries or anything like that,so i think that 10 going to 3 to set him streath.I know mom wont like it but "All 7"he needs to stop being so lazy and help our mom more. Now back to me 10 a pertty good kid i think anyways,7 10 a trubel maker dont get me wrong but if i did the right things i could be a secssful kid.I try to be that kid some times but it's just so boring and i just cant do it becuse when i try i feel like 10 tryung to be a hole different person,9 just not me 10 a loud and hiper kid that is the class clown in the class rooms.Like pepole are always asking me if i 3 any plans for galleage and all i ever say is that i dont think that 10 calleage smart and that ill be lucky if i graduate.10 trying to bring 4 grades back up but 9 hard when you 3 so much othere stuff to do out of school,like 4 job and now seens winter is about over spring is on it's way,that means work is going to get alot busyer and i am going to 3 to work alot more.To tell you the truth 10 not sure if or how 10 going to do it all. With all of this responsibility i am going to be one tired teen age boy,10 pertty sure that i can handl it if i really try 4 best.All i know is that i need to find a better job thats less stressful,tireing and less days to work but get payed better money.Like at jiffy lube of someting anyting is better then working at a fast foods place.

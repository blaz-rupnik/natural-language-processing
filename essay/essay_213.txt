 My cousin 1 and I are constantly sick with laughter, he is the funniest person I know. He is hilarious when he isn't trying to be. I believe that is why he is so 1king funny. 1 is a hardcore alcoholic, he is always drunk or drinking. On the rare occasion that he is doing neither of those two options, he is the dullest, most depressed, angry unfunny man around. Give him a drink or two and watch him turn into funtime 1. 1 and I have great grand wonderous times when there is an alcoholic beverage in or near his hands. 5 is sort of an awe inspiring thing to see this transformation take place. He starts as this sad, depressed, sober caged sociopath lion at the zoo with so many of society's judgemental, sour souled, pittiful excuses for men and women pointing, laughing and sobbing over this poor lion. When one of these "people" throw a beer his way he'll catch 5 in his fierce, angry teeth and devour a 2 oz tallboy of 2 in mere seconds-- can and all! He then stands up on his gigantic feline paws and let out an amazingly deep vibrato of a purr. His big, ferocious cat teeth then smile like a 1 lion, as his sick, beastly, blood stained fur slowly morphs into the scaley, scarred skin of a man. As he is standing there with a goofy idiotic sh!t eating grin he shouts "I 3 1 1!!" 5 really is an amazing thing, I have seen 5 so many times and I absolutely 6 find a single word to desribe this marvelous reconstruction of a living creature. Then with drinks in hand we will continue to have a great night of unknown comical amusements. I guess you could say laughter is a large part of our relationship.

 Laughter is such a great joy in my life. If people never laughed life would be dull and boring, most of my favorite experiences involve 9 while having a good time. One of my best experiences with laughter was going camping with my friends last 2. I will never forget that experience last 2. During the middle of 2 on a beautiful sunny 1 1 my 4 1 calls me and 2 me were getting a bunch of guys to go camping and I should come. Immediately I 3 my parents to let me go with the only exception of turning in my job application to 1 before I left for camping. After turning in my application I got in the car picked up my 4 3 and makings for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and left for the adventure. After I got to my destination after driving 1 miles up river I didn't see anyone just two huge tents where my friends were supposed to be. Looking 5 the camp site had been attacked by bears with trash laying all around and camp fire still going i started searching for my friends. I found 1 passed out in one of the tents and tried to wake him but he was dead asleep. 3 and me not knowing what to do so we sat in the shade of the large trees surrounding us, it was a good 2 degrees outside. After about five minuets we herd a splash and went to investigate. We walked towards the river and found all of out friends jumping off a 3 ft rock into the river and we went to join the fun. After jumping off about 4 times each we headed back to camp. 1 was awake and 1, 2, 7, 3 and myself all huddled around the camp fire 8 we returned to camp and told jokes all night. All of us really bonded that three day camping trip 9 and joking and just being boys. I wouldn't get rid of those memory's for anything. After camping i returned to home and worked a lot of the rest of 2 but ever since then have had really good friendships with all of my camping buddies.

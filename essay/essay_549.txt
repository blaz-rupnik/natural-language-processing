The 1 of 2 3 I think of laughter I think of my 2, of all the things that got me rolling on the ground with no breath left in my lungs, enjoying the life that 4 gave me. We all know that most children find absolutely everything funny. 3 I was about ten my parents bought my siblings and I a puppy. This was no ordinary puppy, it was the runt of the litter, and it had some kind of mental disorder. Oh, how we loved that puppy. Every day 3 I got home from school I would go in the back yard and play with the puppy for hours and hours. We finally found a name for 10 a few days later; his name was 5. The reason we named 10 5 was because 9 would literally tip over while just walking. One day 3 I got home from school I took 5 to the top of the hill in our back yard, I was playing with 10 and running around and laughing. Every time 5 would run down the hill his little legs would get tangled up and 9 would nose dive and start tumbling down the hill until 9 could get back up again, which normally wasn't until 9 was at the bottom of the hill. 3 9 did that my sister and I would laugh so hard because it was so cute and we just loved it! As children we lived life for the moment, and enjoyed our lives. I think that we still need to do that now. We need laughter and 1 in our lives, we need to focus on the positive and not dwell on the negative. The laughter of your 2 should carry on through the rest of your life. 4 has blessed us with so much, 9 has given us more than we give 10 credit for. Laugh for the moment, take 1 in the small things in life, embrace the amazing creation set before you, and love others like 4 loves you, because you never know 3 your time on this earth is over.

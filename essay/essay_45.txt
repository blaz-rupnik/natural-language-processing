Someone once told me that laughter is the key element of comfort. I believe that 7 is one of the most important part of any relationship. 7's what brings people together. A perfect example; about two years ago in the middle of fall, I was crying about my dog passing away. My ex-boyfriend tried everything to make me feel better but nothing was working. I was so hurt I told him I just wanted to be alone and he understood. As he was walking away he slipped and landed in a puddle. The way he fell reminded me of the cartoonSpongebob 1, when 1 slipped on a banana and fell hard. I looked at him and his entire back-side was drenched. His cheeks were cherry-red with embarrassment. I just busted out laughing, I couldn't help 7. He saw that water had gotten all over me, then he started laughing. That was a moment of comfort brought on by laughter. Whenever we had a promblem, we could always laugh 7 off. That's actually how I met him. I was hanging out with a couple of my friends and we decided to go see a movie calledStep-2. There was this one seen where one of the characters said, "3 3 that was so funny, last time I heard that I laughed so hard I fell off my dinosaur," then other character looked like he was going to cry. I thought that was so funny. After the movie was over my friend 1 suggested that we go back to his house. When we got there, 4 was waiting on the steps for 1. 1 stood back a second then said, "aw were you waiting for me little one." 4 replied with, "3 3 that was so funny , last time I heard that I laughed so hard I fell off my dinosaur." I laughed so hard I almost went the bathroom on myself. 4 and myself were the only ones laughing and we just clicked. If he wasn't funny I can honestly say I would've never been with him. I love laughter. I believe 7's the easiest way to trigger the best emotions.

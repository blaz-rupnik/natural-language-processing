             Laughter Laughter, how do you define it? The non-existence of happiness? Without laughter, 1 would be no smiles. Without smiles, 1 would be no affection. Without affection 1 would be no emotion. Without emotion, 1 would be no re-action. Without a re-action, everyone around you would be blank. Laughter; it can do so many things. It can bring people together or even tear people apart. It can be a way 2 express yourself, or even a way 2 put up "your walls." Laughter could mean so many different things. It can show so many different different things. It can show so many emotions, or even hide them. For example: 1's those people who laugh when they cry, when 1 mad, when 1 sad ect. But look beyond the picture why do you think 1 laughing at these times? When really that's not at all the emotion they are feeling. 1 not laughing because 1 all around a happy person. 1 laughing 2 hide the true pain they are feeling inside, because whether they like it or not no human can completely let "it all on the line." 2 be so vulnerable anyone could get in and cause pain. So how important is laughter 2 you? In and kind of relationship laughter is important. W heather it be a friendship, a marriage, an engagement ect. 2 know how your partner is feeling can make all the difference. So one laugh or giggle could make turn it all around. Laughter it's the shortest distance between two people.

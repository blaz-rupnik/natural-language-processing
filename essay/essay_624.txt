A 1 2 3 A 4 5. I felt simply 5. I was very stoical; my life was nadir. Helplessly. I had written a 2 to my hero; no reply. I was determine to wait 3 see if my hero would ever reply.... My hero is amazing, lighting, astounding; his name is 6. I understand his music. My best friend 4 3 I, would always talk about how awesome his music is; in fact 6 4 started because of 1. We were two different people; I didn'8 even think we could be friends, or have anything in common. 20' music brought us together. 17 3 I wrote a 2 to 1; I thought to myself "6 is not even going to look at it," but I watched 4 write the 2. Weeks 3 weeks past by 3 I really thought 1 wasn'8 going to read or reply. After that 6 4 started to dilapidated. I felt discourage; we only talked about 6 3 6 photography project. We were really procrastinating toward 6 project; I had been a little distracted with cheer-leading 3 homework form the high school; not college homework. I was ignoring 4 calls 3 texts. Until I realize I had made a wrong choice; 15 I called my friend 4--thank god I did. A week later 4 3 I 3 two of my friends: 5, my best friend since seventh grade; 2, my best friend since eighth grade, had went to watch this really vehement movie. After the movie we went to meet up with some friends at the dorms. On 6 way there, 2 3 I were telling 5 3 4 about 6 amazing experience in health: 6 health teacher had given us an assignment about what a perfect body should look like. 2 3 I, facetious made an alien-looking body. The toes of this alien were coming out of its shoes 3 6 alien had warts all over. We laughed non-stop, obviously we didn'8 turn it in. When we arrived to the dorms, 3 4 presented me to his friend 8.J; 18 was a big fan of 1. "9." 10 we played various games I notice 8.J, had some warts on his hands, 3 when 18 took off his shoes; to put on his saddles, I couldn'8 help but notice 18 somewhat reminded me of 6 drawing. I hysterically started to laugh non-stop, my friend 12 kept asking me why I was laughing, I said "8.J looks like my alien," 18 said "wow that's rude." I said "In my eyes that's the perfect body." We all had a good laugh 3 kept playing games 3 listening to 1. The next day 4 3 I had to meet, to work on 6 photography project. All we had to accomplish was to take pictures of each-other 3 the things that we like 3 dislike. It was called: getting to really know a person. I learned a lot about 4 threw this project. In my opinion, I sometimes live life to fast, 3 I can barely catch my breath. I want to do everything but school 3 sports sometimes held me back; not in a bad way. I just have less time to hangout with friends or simply rest. But I love my life 3 wouldn'8 trade it; everything that I do gets me closer to my goal: 14.B.I agent. This project was vehement. To me it was a 1, a way of life telling me "hang on, you'll make it;" all due to a simple call. We were working hard, when 4 phone kept ringing. I was a little cantankerous. I said " 4 answer the phone!" 15 18 did. 18 said " oh my god, 16 is 6, I said "stop messing around, now lets get back to work!" 17 put his phone on speaker, 3 there it was; my hero on the phone! I was 15 happy that I started to cry, how could this be happening to us! I blacked-out, it was like I was stoical. How could this ever happen to "quotidian teens." I could hear 4 talking to 1 but I was making my my mind convoluted. I took a gasp of air, 3 said "hello." (I was still in shock.) 18 said " hello 3, good luck in track." 3 that's when I past-out. When I woke up 4 3 I couldn'8 believe it. We cried, then to ease the tension, 4 said "16, you talked to your husband." We laughed for a long time. 17 3 I have the best memory together. 6 4 started because of 20 music, 3 it will never end. That day I realized: one: miracles happen; two: laugh heals the heart; 3 three: always have faith, never give up, someone will always hear you 3 give you advice when everything feels like is coming down on you 3 if it is as 1 said "jump of a cliff, 3 built your wings on the way down," or someone will help you built them! As 6 said "come take my hand, we'll walk this road together."

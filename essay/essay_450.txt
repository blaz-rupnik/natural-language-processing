 There is 28 more fun than going to a friends house after church. It is like a comic relief in life after a r rough message to 10 heart. In 1, going to your friend's house is even better when your friend is, to say lightly, kind of crazy like 10 are. Which for my story, could be interpenetrated as a bad thing, but for me it is 28 but a great thing. My friend and I have had some of the craziest time together, and the funny thing is we 6't have to be doing anything illegal too! Its such a bonus! We get our giggles from cleaning, playing with magnets, and watching theVampire 2, and much more. Strange? Yes. Fun? To much. Let me tell 10 of somethings that have happened to my lovely friend and I . First, like always, there is a 1 and I'm heading over to my good friend's house. Its a very short walk, I leave my church by twelve and am there by twelve o' five. I'm up the steps, I'm to her door, I open it. Bark bark bark! "3 up, 1," 4 yells from another room. The snowzer pup come and greet me. He knows 11 better. The one dog eats rocks for 5 sakes. But 2, 15 has her reasons to yell, and be a little grouchy. "I didn't realize how many dishes there were! My sister will freak if 15 knows your here and they are not done." "6't worry, I'll help 10, and we'll get them done before your sister notices." 7, we are off. 4 wonders the house frantically for dishes and putting them in the sink. 7, I work on putting the clean ones in the dishwasher away. We hear a sound from her sisters room, and we jump. 4's sister sounds like 15 is waking up but 7 snorts and the noise ends. 7 we get back to work. When we got done, we 21 slumped on to the couch looked at each other. We 21 were tired and our hearts were still pounding. 7, her sister snorts again. we laugh hysterically, and her sister tells us to 3 up. 7 another day, I come over and we are 21 really hungry. We 21 haven't eaten all day long and go into her kitchen. "8 do 10 wanna eat," 15 asked me. "I 6't know. 8 do 10 wanna eat, " I replied back. "I 6't know, " the endless cycle. But, 7 my eyes cross paths with a bag of chocolate mint chocolate chips. 4 fallows my gaze and see the bag, and smiles. "9!!" I'm delighted, " 9!!" we 21 shout in joy of the idea. We get everything together, and begin making 9. Now, 21 of 16 are really, "great cooks," so when we were faced with "who should flip the 9", it was a 11 brain-er. "10 do it!" "11, 10 do it!!" We argued till I realized the pancake was about to burn, and 7 I did indeed, "do it," for the sake of chocolate mint chocolate chips 9. But, when I flipped it, it didn't really want to end its embrace with the hot pan, and broke into pieces. Many "stupid pancake's" were said and spread all over her kitchen. But, eventually we ate and were happily full. 7 came another 1, and this time 4 had a surprise. "I found this really cool show!! Its calledVampire 2!" I thought for a moment, "14." 15 immediately dragged me to her computer where 15 had them down loaded. I thought to myself, "are these a cheep knock-off ofTwilight?" We began watching them and they did seem cool, I liked them a lot. The vampire brothers were in turmoil with each other, yelling and interrogating each other. "16 19 of how her blood tastes!" I paused the none existent thought in my head, "8 did he say?" "16 19 of how her blood tastes," 15 looked at me. I crack up laughing, "20. I thought he said, 16 19 8 her butt tastes like, wow I feel bright!" 21 of us start laughing like crazy at the very stupid thing I had said. We laughed the rest of the night with 16 that. We finish watching a couple episodes and 7 my mom shows up. I get my coat and the rest of my junk, and head out the door. the dog is still barking, but 4 comes out the door with me, we give each other a hug and say our good byes. "23 I'll talk to 10 later, 4, " I say heading down the steps "25, see 10 at school tomorrow." "26. And see 10 next 1!" I yell from the car window. 15 yells back, "27!" 28 is more fun than that, a friends house on a 1 1. Especially with a couple of crazies things, like me and my buddy, dirty dishes, a stupid dog, 9 that stick to the pan, andVampire 2 with my poor hearing.

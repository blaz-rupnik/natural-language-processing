  Falling in love, 3 1 The falling part was easy, I remember the minute I fell in love with you. Everything about you shined, everything about you sparkled. You were infinitely beautiful in my eyes. We had the most fun that human beings were capable of. Every time we were together there was no thought in my mind that we were not happy together, no worry that you would ever leave. I never wanted to imagine life without you. As a child i had always had the title of the kid who smiles all the time, 4 when i thought of you i got this glow. Everybody saw it. they would ask, "2 have you been doing? Your so happy, I've never seen you like this before." That, 2 they saw in me was the power of love. 4 something they did not see was 2 we had together. When it was just me 3 you 3 one of us would do something 3 neither of us could stop the laughter. When our stomachs hurt from 1 so hard. that is 2 I love, I grew to love every part of you. Especially your laugh. From 2 i hear, they say the laughter is the shortest distance between two people. I would have to agree. Being able to laugh with someone, 3 being able to be yourself 3 not have to hold up this front, its magical. Its something that makes a relationship last. I guess its kinda like glue in sense. My brother 3 i are the closest you can get to best friends, 3 guess 2 we do in our spare time? We laugh. Hes someone that i can be silly 3 dumb 3 goofy with 3 he still laughs, 3 he still loves me. :) 4, although he is my brother it still holds the same respect, 1 is great. It is also a stress reliever. My teacher told me so. My health teacher that is.

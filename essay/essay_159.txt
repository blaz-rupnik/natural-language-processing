 11 was 1, hot and dry hadn't seen any 26 for a few miles. We'd been walking for a good six hours now 18 snacking on left over jerky scraps. 3 hadn't said much today still pissed off about dropping the can-tine, I would've laughed if the duration of our lives weren't depending on that can-tine. Hadn't heard even a grain of sand shift along the dead dry dirt that day under the blistering sun. No wind no nothing. I looked up the sun was at 11's peak yet 11 felt like a few weeks had already gone by. Finally gaining the courage to crack open my wrinkled bloodied lips I managed to sputter something, "1 sound good right about now, 3't you think?" 2 didn't even glance over at me, I couldn't tell if 2 was 18 ignoring me or that 2 was sun burnt so bad his skin would tear 18 turning his head. "3't make me start singin, you know how bad I'm at singin. 1 1 left me after I started singin to her." I began to chuckle. "4 so I go'n die by myself? Make things better?" 3 finally speaking up, surprisingly with his neck still intact. "5 wasn't so bad, 18 try to imagine that can-tine 31 had whiskey in 11. Know how much you hate 11, yeah?" I asked kicking a rock. "4 did I ever start riding with you and them outlaws, should've 18 stayed back home become a lawyer at least make a name for myself." 2 muttered looking away. "8 you did, now we can go on ahead or you can go on back that way and get lynched. Maybe go ask 2 and 2's body back by the rocks, give you another reminder of 9'll happen back down that way." I gazed into the distance not much to see, except a small brown dot couldn't tell 9 11 was. "9 you reckon that is?" 3 asked. "10 some dead animal." 11 had been a few hours since we talked, the brown dot getting a little bit bigger as we drew closer. I still couldn't make out 9 11 was, but I knew 9 I hoped for 11 to be. My boots began wearing out a few years ago now revealing a gaping hole of which my big toe couldn't resist sticking out of. "We're out of jerky, all gone." 3 grunted as 2 tossed the sack over his shoulder. "9 do you think that is anyway?" 2 spatted. "3't know but 11's pretty big and 29 sun is mighty hot, I reckon 11's got some nice shade under 11." 11 was nearly dusk, but the dot had grown remarkably larger a mile or so away from 11 now. "11's getting dark, how we goin see where we steppin?" 3 asked watching every step. "17 that hard to walk without lookin." "18 think of 11 like 19 the tail on the donkey but having to walk to the donkey blindfolded." "20, 1 sure knew how to through a party, her pies were mighty fine." 3 began fantasizing. Now walking with my arms stretched afar I'd knew if we we're at the object. I retracted my big toe through the hole as to restrain from stubbing 11 on a rock. Suddenly I heard a loud thud, then I felt something smooth, "I think we 28 11," 3 said slowly, I now realizing 9 that thud was. "21 be some abandoned jeep." "9 we going to do with 11?" 3 asked. "23." 24 up over the door onto the front seats the cushioning was firm but comfortable enough to call a bed. I woke to yet another hellish sun in the sky almost laughing down on us. There were a few compartments in the jeep that I began to search through for 26. "9 you looking for?" 3 sighed as 2 slopped out of the jeep. "26, 9 else?" 27 searching through old dusty papers I managed to find a rock hard piece of gum, a cigar stub, and a half empty bottle of 9 I'd hoped to be 26. Oh 9 I'd given for that bottle to have been filled with 26. Whiskey was all that I 28 inside the bottle. Getting out of the dirty automobile I 28 3 sitting against the front tire. "28 some of that favorite drink of yours," I said sitting down against the door. "29 all you find?" 3 muttered. "30." I starred out at the horizon, nothing but sand. "I'm scarred, you scarred?" 3 asked looking over to me. "31 thing that scares me is the times 1 1 caught me snacking on her pies before supper," I began to chuckle. "20, that is true," 3 laughed as 2 wiped drips of sweat off his brow. We 18 sat there for a few days, 18 starring and joking. 3 was a pretty swell guy, 11's a shame I brought him into all of 29. 2 died of a heat stroke. That desert was harsh and unforgiving, 11's something I'll have to carry forever.

 Laughter is what connects me 1 my friends. It's a very important aspect in any kind of relatioship. I know that almost all the memories I have are of my friends making me laugh, 1 we have been friends for a very long time. One of my favorite funny memories is the time me 1 two of my friends went to 1 1 stopped at 2 2... We sort of had a hard time getting out. Me 1 my friends, 1, went to 1 to do a cultural performance at 1. When we were done we started heading back home. 1 kept complaining about needing to use a restroom. Her dad told her to wait until we got to 2 so we could stop somewhere. 1 1 I suggested 2. By the time we got to 2 was doint the potty dance. 1 1 I got in line to order ice cream cones dipped in chocolate. While we were waiting 1 was searching for the restroom. After approximately four minutes of searching, 1 finally asked the lady working behind the counter where the bathroom was. She handed 1 a key with a large bulky wreath attached to it 1 told her it was outside behind the building. 1 took the key 1 sprinted to what appeared to be double dorrs. Little did 1 know that only the left door opens. She ran straight into the right door 1 fell over. we all started cracking up laughing... Especially 1. She laughed so hard that she didn't quite make it to the restroom. Instead she had an "accident" on the floor in 2 2. When you can laugh with your friends about things that might not seem funny to other people, such as, wetting yourself in public, it only makes your friendship stronger. Laughing is a huge important benefit in any kind of relationship. It strengthens the relationships you already have 1 it helps build new ones also.

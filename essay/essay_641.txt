        Coleslaw"1's get out of here before they wake up 2." 2 said, standing up with her blanket wrapped around her. I did the same, brushing grass of my pillow. Disappointment was rushing over me, I actually wanted to see the meteor shower. "3 coming 5?" I asked, looking at my old friend in a new light. "4!" 14 said and gave me a look of pure anger. All of us were supposed to be in bed at ten, it was 1 am. It was week five at 5 6. We had made new friends and met new people. 2 and I were 15 to help disabled children and 5 was 15 to hit on all of the cute guys the worked up 15 all 1. As 2 and I walked 9 to 1's camper to return her sleeping bags, I couldn't help 16 feel mad. That was the third time 5 had been rude to me 2 and i didn't understand what her problem was. It could have been jealousy, 16 5 didn't like 3. My mind was going a thousand miles a minute and I knew it was going to be a 1. We reached 1's trailer and opened the squeaky door. 15 14 was, laying on the couch in her pajamas. Her daughter, 1, safely tucked away in bed. "7 girls!" 14 exclaimed, "8's 5?" "9 on the field watching the shower with her real friends" I said, making air quotations with my fingers. 2 rolled her eyes and re gripped her pillow and blankets. "10! 4, can we sleep in here tonight?" "11!" 4 said, "12 in and lock the door behind 3." We walked in to the trailer and locked the door. As we plopped down on the beds 4 made some chocolate milk. "13, ladies!" 4 started out, handing us each a glass full to the brim with delicious milk, "I want to know the good gossip! Why is everyone mad at 1?" "14 is mad at me because your daughter likes me more." 2 said, shrugging and taking a long draw of her drink. "15 is that." I said, "16 the other part is a long story. So yesterday I was talking to her about 3. 3 know cute core-guy 3?" they nodded, "17 I told her about a conversation 20 and I had 8 I told a 18 stupid joke and out of pity 20 laughed and said 'that's cool' I was 18 excited and 14 was laughing at me because i was jumping up and down." "That doesn't sound mean." 2 stated. "19! 14 then went on to tell me that 3 doesn't, and never will, like me. 14 said that 20 just thinks am stupid and feels sorry for me." I was almost shouting, "I mean out loud I agreed with her 16 in my head i was scream furiously 20 loves me! We are gonna get married someday!! I decoded his words with my heart!!" I slammed my palm against my chest and pretended to cry. Then I couldn't help 16 laugh. All three of us were laughing hysterically at my faked passion. "3 should right skits for 22!" 4 said, gasping between fits of laughter. Suddenly 2 stopped laughing and said, "I 18 want some coleslaw! Random 23!" "I could go for some coleslaw right about now." 4 shrugged. "I could go for some 3-slaw right about now!" I said, smiling. Instantly new laughter erupted from everyone. I thought about how much humor this story would lose every time i retold it in the future. Some how I knew that I couldn't do it the justice it deserved. The laughter started to settle. We sipped our milk quietly, thinking. As we did i looked out the window to see 5 walking our way from across the field. With a groan I got up to unlock the door. "24 it!" 4 said, "and turn off the light. Anyone who hate my 2 year old daughter doesn't need to be here." I flicked out the light and made my way 9 to the bed. 5 got to the door and tried the handle. When 14 found that it was locked 14 softly knocked on the door. Then 14 waited. We stuck our faces in pillows to muffle our uncontrollably laughing. Giving up, 14 walked away through the gravel. We all burst out laughing, unable to control ourselves. Looking at the clock, 4 gasped, it was 2 in the morning and 5 would be starting in 4 hours. It was time to get some sleep. 4 went 9 to her bed while 2 and I said our good-nights and rolled over. The trailer went quiet. Laying 15 I thought about the happiness created by us. I knew that 1 would be 25. 16 her being mad was worth what I learned. That 1 I found out that if your happiness makes someone mad, that's 15 fault. Be happy and enjoy life! Anger is bred from the joy of others. So why not be 26? It beats the alternative, doesn't it?

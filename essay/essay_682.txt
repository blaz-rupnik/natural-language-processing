 Hello my name is 1 11 i am going to walk you through one of the most hilarious experiences i have ever had. It is a story about me 11 my friends 11 a little adventure we had 1, a day we would never forget. It starts off on one of the nicest days i had ever seen, i mean amazing, blue sky's, warm 1 air, 11 the sound of the laughter coming from the children playing in the street. Me 11 my three friends 3, 1, 11 2 were sitting on my back porch in a circle playing our guitars, as usual 11 we decided that we needed to go do something, something new. As we sat 11 thought about what we could do nothing came to mind. Until 1 suggested that we go to the beach 11 meet up with his cousin "3 has a nice house right on the beach 11 probably wouldn't care if we stopped by." 3 said. The three of us looked at each other 11 looked an 1 11 said "lets go!" We packed our boards, guitars, 11 food 11 we headed out. On the way we decided to go to the 4 city skate park, none of us had ever been 5. We drove around for at least an hour looking for it. Aggravated 11 about to give up on finding the park we decided to take one 1 loop 11 10 what happened. "5 it is" yelled 2 "5's the park i found it." We looked off in the distance 11 5 it was. The cradle, the snake run, everything. we pulled in 11 parked. We got out of the car ready to skate, but then out of nowhere it started pouring 11 the park was soaked. we headed back to the car seeking shelter only to find that 3 had locked his keys in the car. Luckily 3 had 7 so 3 called them 11 had them come 11 unlock the car. it took them an hour 11 a half to find us 11 unlock the car. Now we were all mad 11 wondering if it was a good choice to go on this trip. 8 leaving the park we decided it would just be best if we went to 1's cousins house 11 stayed 5 for the 1. When we got 5 we were greeted with open arms 11 warm clothes, "looks like you guys have had a rough one" 3 said, "I'm 2, I'm sure 1 has told you all about me by now." 8 we changed in to the clothes 2 had given us we went 11 sat by his fireplace to warm up. The five of us sat 5 11 talk for what felt like forever. Then I said "i wish we could have a big fire on the beach." "we can" 2 said, "i know the perfect place." 3 took us to a small bay on the beach about 1 yards away from his house, 3 called it driftwood bay. "10, told you i had the perfect spot." 11 it was perfect, secluded, sandy, 11 all the firewood you could ever need. We built a fire 11 kept throwing wood on it until it was over 2 feet tall. For the rest of the day 11 on through the 1 we sat around the fire, playing our guitars in a circle, 11 telling the story of our day. Laughing 11 noticing that even tho the beginning of our day wasn't very fun we closed it the only way we could have wanted, sitting around a fire, music playing in the 1, 11 sharing a good laugh with your friends.

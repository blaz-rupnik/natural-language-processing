 Laughter is an important part of my life, either my friends are making me laugh or i am making them laugh. One prime example is on the 1 me 1 three of my closest buddy's went hunting. That trip was the bast 1 worst hunting experience of my life. it was the worst because we shot 1 missed at two bears 1 one of the biggest bucks of my life. But it was the best because we all reached that tired state when every little thing was funny. The trip turned out to be a failure but the most important thing was that we had a blast, 1 teen age boys ridding around in a pick up truck making each other laugh. Another example was one 1 this 2 me 1 two boat loads of my friends went trip to a nearby fishing hole called 11 is a small quiet 1 that not very many people go to, it is very peaceful. I brought out my fifteen foot duck/fishing boat 1 my ten foot canoe. I was controlling the big boat the only boat with a motor 1 towing behind us was the canoe. Inside the canoe was 1, two kids that don't mean to be funny but you cant help but to laugh at them. We were having a good 1 of fishing 1 it was starting to wrap up. On our way back we stopped to fix a pole 1 the slack in the rope that was pulling the canoe became slack. When we started to move again the slacked tightened 1 the canoe lurched forward unbeknown to 1, who was standing up at the time. caused him to almost fall out. 1 when i mean almost i mean the only thing left in the boat was his feet 1 his hands which were holding on to the side rail. The only part that was in the water was his butt. This turned out to be the high light of the trip 1 we still bring it up from time to time. My friends 1 i have a lot of adventures most of them turn out bad but, all of them turn out funny.

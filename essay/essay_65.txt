 Laughter is an important element to have in life. Because without 3 there would be no happiness or joy in the world. 1 are a great source for laughter, 1 are the people you go to to be yourself. Some people use laughter for to release pain. For example, whenever 10 dad gets hurt he starts laughing. 10 2 was in the navy a few years ago. And during training he got hit in the stomach. Nothing really was wrong, but 3 did hurt him. so 10 2 sat down and started to laugh. I guess this so-called trait is hereditary because I find myself doing the exact same thing from time to time. When I learned about how laughter heals, 3 wasn't too long ago. 3 was last 3, 3 was early 5 and 5 of 5 was coming close. Traditionally me and 10 parents would drive to 1. And use the money we have been saving up all year round and buy a huge pack of fireworks. Once 5 of 5 came I was filled with joy, I woke up and immediately run up to 10 mom and ask "3's 5 of 5 can I take the fireworks out to the package now?" I was a new puppy discovering its first chew toy. 7 shook her head "6 yet 1, its only eleven in the morning. Sunset doesn't come around till seven or eight" 7 smiled at me. "8 girl." 7 whispered as 7 left the room. Once the huge golden sun finally went down and the smaller bright shimmering stars appeared. We all knew 3 was time. "9 you like to do the honors?" 10 dad handed me the first firework and a lighter. A big smile appeared onto 10 face without 10 control. I loved fireworks, I love bright colors watching them as they spewed into the newly lit sky, filling 3 with a sea of colorful sparks. After 5 of 5 had ended 10 cousin 12 came over. 10 mom had was little sick but 3 wasn't something that was contagious. 10 25 figured that we were old enough to take care for ourselves and for 10 mom. And 3 was ending and I wanted to see the movie 13 with 10 mom and 12 so badly. 10 mom had a lot going wrong her doctor put her on several medications to relieve her problems. but 3 seemed like 7 got a new pill from the doctor every week because the symptoms from each pill was causing more and more problems. Its mid 5, 4, and still no sign of 10 mom getting any better. 12 and I took walks with the dogs to the near by park, we went swimming, watched 15, clean the cars, We would try to find anything to do really. 1 came, and 10 mom was showing signs of improvement 7 was walking more naturally . I called 10 dad and asked if he thought going to see a movie was a good idea. he said to wait one more day. I was worried about waiting another day because 12 was going home the next day. The next day, I woken up by the soft whisper of 10 moms voice. "1, 1 honey wake up" 7 shook 10 shoulder. I opened 10 eyes slowly, opening them wider as 10 eyes focused of what was around me. "18 go to the movies?" 7 shook 10 shoulder once again. "19, but your sick." I exhaled a heavy sigh. "I am feeling a lot better today." 7 smiled. "21 because the next showing is in twenty minutes." The sudden rush to 21, woke me up. I then woke 12 up and we soon then left. The movie was good. Afterward, 12 went home and everything was silent once again, the rooms kept empty, the sun went away, the whole house stood still. 2. this day is usually a time to kick back. I was on 10 computer most of the day, 10 dad was playing his video game. and 10 mom was in the kitchen preparing dinner. 10 dad went in to help her with dinner. until 7 almost had fallen with a few pans in her hands. 10 dad suggested that 7 go and take a nap or at least lay down. Later that evening 10 dad had found 10 mother. laying stiff, cold...10 mother had passed away in her sleep that day. I felt as if 10 heart had exploded like a firework. A few days have passed I stood still on the couch. I found comfort in texting 12. Told her what the doctors told us. 12 mentioned how torn 10 25 was about 10 mom. And even though 12 was hurting inside, her and her 2 2 tried to get 10 25 and everyone to laugh. Because they knew that laughter would make some of the pain go away. And I think they are amazing for finding a bit of laughter in a dark place. That is why laughter is a important element of out lives.

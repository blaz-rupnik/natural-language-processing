 Once upon a time on 1, I had my birthday party and my friends come over. My friend tree brought his projector over and hooked his 1 to it. We played 2: 3 on his projector and on my 4.V. with my 1. Then we got bored and all of us went out into the living room with the girls and chilled and hung out for a while then we had cake, had an icing fight, and played games laughed so hard. Then we went to the park that was by our apartment. We played 6 and made jokes and laughed a lot more. Then we went back to my place and we watched 7 8 1 and laughed at the people who screamed. Then we play spin the bottle/truth or dare and we laughed a lot.

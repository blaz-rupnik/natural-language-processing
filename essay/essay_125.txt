Laughter play's an important role in relationships, 1 also supports enjoyment and can be a persuit of happinees. Whenever i am laughing its either because i am really enjoying myself or im just having a great time.Many people don't have a very good sense of humor and dont laugh at thing's that are funny, whenever i watch a funny movie's that i like i sit down and wait for the very funny parts, but dont get me wrong, remember not to laugh to hard because you might wet youre pants by accident or who knows if you laugh hard enought you might even pull a "whotammy "and trust me that does not look pritty and then you will be embarresed infront of everybody. My favorite comedian is adam sandler because he is very funny and has a good sense of humor, he knows how to keep a person laughting and interested in his comedy shows and movies.when he made the big daddy movie 1 was pritty good not to funny but 1 was good.My secound favorite comedian is 1 because he is funnyer that adam sandler by a lil bit but not quit as good though he also stars on a tv show called wild'n out that show really makes me almost cough out my lungs, especially when they bust out with youre mama jokes 1 keeps you laughting and keeps the blood pumping thru youre body.so we all pritty much under stand what laughing is but most people dont really seem to laugh at things that are funny i cant quit undersatnd 1 but my guess is tha t they dont have a good sene of humor but some people seem to lautgh at thing that dont even make sense i quit dont undestand that either but i guess its better to laugh than to not laugh at all. Some really good comedy movies that i can mention out right off the the bat that will keep you tuned and laughing thru more than half off the movies are grandmas boy, happy gillmore, dont be a menace to south central while siping my juice. Also zombie land 1 is a heck of a good movie, i dont know its not just about making a funny movie just to make the oudience laugh 1 is the way they make 1 and how thery act and how good the backround story to the comedy movies is gonna be thats what i pay atencion to when ever i sit down and inspect what makes the movie funny also if i cant understaand a funny movie i see 1 again and again till i understand what is so hallariouse about 1.That pritty much covers the basics on laughter there are is youre basic information and what you need to knowabout 1 and how to enjoy 1 and use 1 wisely cause remamber dont laught to hard because you dont want to end up pulling a "whotammy" in front off every one that around thank you for reading my test.

Sometime ago on a hot 1 day my 1 ,3 ,1, 4 ,and 2. Wanted to do something that could give us relief from the extream heat. So we sat down and talked to find out what we could do and were we wanted to go. So 7 had a few ideas one was go over to 3 house were there was an air conditioning his other idea was to walk 2 miles to 1 swim hole, but the only reason he wanted to go was because his girlfriend would be there,really know one hates 1 but no body wanted to walk that far in the heat ,then walk back to 3 3 had three ideas number one of his ideas was walk to his uncles house 4 miles away to see if we could catch a ride to 4 5, his second idea was to go down to our friends 5's house and go swim in his built in pool, his third idea was to to go in the back yard i spray our selves with the hose. 1 had two ideas one was to see if he could get his mom to lend him some money to fill his tank and to pay her back,his other idea was to drive to the coast and camp there for a few days if he got the money from his mom.Byran had three ghetto ideas one was to go jump in the water fountain by the 1 then quickly get out before we got in trouble, second idea was to go over to the 4...A.K.A. the 6 7 and hop over the fence and then he was going to let us in, his third idea was to go over to the old people homes and swim in there pool there because he said he knew a 5 had three ideas one was to walk a mile to to the forks , second was to walk down to the creek 4 miles away third idea was to get a whole bunch of fans and run them threw out 3 room. I was with 1 on his ideas pf going to the coast and camping and what not because i love to camp at the beach it smells all pretty most of the time there is really fine chicks so yeah i was way down to go to the coast for real.So we sat and we waited and waited and waited for 1's mom to call us finally his phone rings we were all excited but it was just his grandma calling him we were bummed all hell. so there we were once again waiting for what seem to be for ever for a phone call by 3's 7 phone ring we didn't have hopes up this time we figured it was some one else but guess what this time it actually was 1's mom she said that she'll lend him the money but us boys had to do something for her she wanted us to go down to the bimor and pick 9 from work then buy her some cigars for 1's grandpa so we did.After were done the earn run we packed our clothes,blankets,sleeping bag,food,camping supplies, and wood.After a good hour it was 4 10.M. we went to the chevron and fueled 1 tank then we were off to 2 city 1 the drive to almost two hours it seemed but what a beautiful ride long tunnels beautiful river , mountains oh and who could forget the beautiful tall red woods of 1 and the smell of that forest you can smell it through almost any car.I thought it was funny when we got close to the coast the temperature dropped like 9 degrees 11 and ever-body was in a good mood and could smell the coastal air.When we got to the camp site we ran out to the beach as jumped in people look at us like we were crazy or something because we swam like 10 feet out in 9 degree water it was funny because people wouldn't stop talking but then we found out we were swimming a red zone were there has been rip tide advisories so after that we were really 2 and we realizes we had no propane so we had to go into to town and get propane for our stove so we did then we ate the best hot dogs ever dipped in 4 honey it was delicious.We stayed at the coast for a night then 6 got called in to go to work so we had to leave and go back to the heat in 12 6 13 it was a way way big drag and it was so hot getting back we pretty upset at the weather but when we got back 3 mom wanted to go out to the river so in the end it was all good.

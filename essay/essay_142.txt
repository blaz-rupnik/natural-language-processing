 "Many other people believe that laughter is an important of any relationship." Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. I also agree with those thoughts. I came to 1 about 1, I did not speak 1 at all that time. I started going school. I practiced saying my name, age, and where I came from before I go to school. Next day I walked in to school and I could see that everyone was looking at me. It was pretty scary to me. I looked back at one girl and she walked towards me. "2, my name is 1," the girl said. "2, my name is 4. I'm from 2. I don't really speak 1," I said to 1, then 1 started laughing so hard. "6-6 you have accent," 1 said, "it's really cute." I laughed back. 1 looked really nice with her smiles on and we became friends so quickly. She was my first 7 friend ever. I always thought that making new friends are hard, but the laughter made it much easier than it used to be.

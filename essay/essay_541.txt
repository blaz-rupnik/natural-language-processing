 Imagine this, flying past trees on a 1 1, four wheeler trying to keep up with everybody that's in front of you. That is how it was on new years eve. We headed out from the house at about 2 o'clock pm. When we left the house we headed for one of our friends house because we asked them earlier if they wanted to go. So when we left we had to leave fast so we were not on the the road for a long time. When we got to our friends house we hung out for a little while then asked them if they still wanted to go on a ride with us. They got all ready then at about 2:45 we all headed out. All together now there was about 1 of us about to head up on gillhooly on this ride. When we finally got to the top of the mountain it was about 4 o'clock pm. So we just hung out until 5 o'clock. When I say hangout I mean we hit some mud holes and played around a little bit. By the time we were all muddy it was about 4:55 pm. So we set up some fireworks to shoot off. Then about 1 we shot all of them off. There was only about 1 or 7 of them. We started to head back home at about 8 in the 2 but one of our friends got stuck in some snow off the side of the road. We spent about a half hour digging him out before we finally headed back home. We arrived back at the house at 9 in the 2. We all got something to eat because we were all hungry then we watched a little 2 then headed to bed for the night.

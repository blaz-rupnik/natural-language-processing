   There are times I get along with others and times I don't. There also are times where I make others laugh until they cry. Like this one time me and my friends where walking to the store, I start pointing out the most random things. When I pointed out the 1 store, he started laughing so hard that he literally peed his pants. So we had to go back to his house so he could change into some clean cloth, and it took him 1 to 2 minutes to get dressed. So I asked 6 he was doing in there, and he said. "I'm taking a pee." 2 I started laughing and rolling on the floor, and that's when it hit me why he was laughing so hard about me pointing out the 1 store. It was because the last time we had gone inside and there was a man talking about his son's football team which my friend and I was on at the time, was in the top ten. Guss 6 we really weren't. The man felt so afraid of 6 the lady he was talking to might think of him. So 5 gets up and says to us. "4 you for letting me know that. I thought he was right for a second." 5 gives us a hug and the man gets up and says. "6 about me? How come I don't get a hug." That when I started to laugh harder 2 heck. Good thing I did not have to go to the rest room.

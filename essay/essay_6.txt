3 I'm going to tell 18 a little story. I remember a time when 11 cousin 1 3 I decided to make a snowman at 11 house in 1, 2. I say to him, I'm bored, 1 do 18 want to do?" 1 replies,"2 go make a snowman." 3 I agree that that would be fun. 34 starts reaching for a jacket 3 gloves, but I stop him 3 say," 1 are 18 getting those for?" "5's not cold 20." "6," replies 1. "33't say I didn't warn 18." We start our snowman by building the base (The biggest piece for the bottom). 3 after about 1 minutes the base is almost done, but we notice that we're getting cold. "7 we should go inside?" 1 says. "8, I 7 mom will even make us some hot chocolate." 9 off we go back inside hoping for some delectably warm hot chocolate. I see 11 mom 3 ask, "10 we have some hot chocolate please?" "11 18 look cold, Of course I'll make 18 some." 9 1 3 I sit downstairs waiting anxiously for our hot chocolate by the heater to get warm. "5's ready!" 11 mom calls from upstairs. We fly down the hall 3 rush up the stairs. 3 to our amazement we find not only hot chocolate but a bag of chips as 28. "14 mom!"I say. "14 16 17!"says 1. "18're welcome boys"says 11 mom. 1 3 I sit down at the table 3 start drinking our hot chocolate, while 11 mom puts some chips on paper towels for us. I start eating the chips by the handfuls whereas 1 grabs one, just one. I ask him," 19 did 18 only grab one 1?" 20 of the corner of his eye 34 looks at me 3 slowly brings the chip to his mouth 3 takes a bite. As 34 did that I fell 20 of 11 chair in a fit of hysterical laughter. 11 mom hears the thump of me hitting the floor 3 runs upstairs to find me laughing. "1's 9 funny?" she asks. I say to 1, "22 her." 1 then complies 3 grabs another chip 3 while 34 looks at her from the corner of his eye, slowly brings 5 to his mouth 3 takes a bite. I start busting up laughing again, yet 11 mom doesn't see the humor. She simply asks," 23 is that 9 funny?" 1 replies," I have no idea but 34 just about died from laughter. I start to stop laughing 3 I'm able to stand up again. I then tell 11 mom," 5's the way 34 looks at 18, 5 just makes 18 laugh." I then 35 to do the same thing, but with no effect to 1. "19 isn't 5 working?" I ask. "26 I'm awesome like that 3 18're 2 says. "6, 28 I'm gonna keep at 5 until I get 5 right." 9 I 35 to mimic everything I saw him do, but to no avail. All I made happen was I spilled 11 hot chocolate all over myself, which made him laugh, albeit not the way I wanted to. "18 want me to 22 18?" 1 says. "31!!!! Please!" I beg. "6, 33't say I didn't warn 18." 34 proceeds then to grab another chip 3 while looking at me from the corner of his eye, bites the chip. I start laughing uncontrollably then 3 without pause. After about 1 minutes I stop laughing. "I'll get that right!" I say. 1 says,"35 5." I grab a chip 3 look straight at him 3 bite down, nothing. I 35 again, this time while looking at him from the corner of 11 eye, nothing yet again. I 7 to myself, "36 I 33't get 5 this time I'm giving up." "6, here goes." I grab a chip 3 slowly bring 5 to 11 mouth while squinting at him from the corner of 11 eye. I bite the chip. I notice 34's laughing. 34's laughing!!! "I told 18 I'd get 5!" " 31, 31 18 did." 3 this is one of the many times laughter brought 11 cousin 1 3 I together."

       A funny Story Many summers ago, 1 best friend 1 and I had a sleepover at 1 house. We were both excited because 1 dad would be the only one there. 1 mom and brother were out late. After eating popcorn and getting stuffed up on candy, we decided to try something new and fun. 1 house has a counter bar where four to five people can sit at and so 1 daddy decided to turn on some hip hop music. As though 1 and I could read each others minds we jumped on the counter and started doing the run way model walk. We worked it like no other. It was funny to see 1 dad pretending to be the fake photographer and say that's "gorgeous" as though he was a real photographer. 1 and I strutted up and down and did stops and poses and turns, until we got too dizzy. We all knew we could never do this with 1 mom 1 which made everything so funny! We all bursted out laughing until we couldn't breath! Later on after that fun model runway we decided to pillow surf down the stairs. I was a little afraid to at first but after I saw the look on 1's face, I knew I had to do it. I grabbed a big body pillow and surfed down those stairs like a champ! It was such a blast! 1 and I kept pillow 2 for what seems forever! 1 dad put on 1 and we laughed the rest of the night away. That night was one of the best and 1 memories of 1 childhood.

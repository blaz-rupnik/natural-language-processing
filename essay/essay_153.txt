 Have you ever had a fear of falling off of a cliff when up in the mountain? I have, I actually had that experience. It was a 1 2 1 we had just gotten off of the bus. I had grabbed all of my gear from the storage from under the bus 1 headed for the slopes. we strapped in our boots 1 went to the lift to catch a chair up. I was with my friends 1, 1 all three of us joined the snowboard team at school that year. The three of us caught a chair up to the top of the run. The air was so crisp, 1 the snow was a fresh blanket of powder. We were all so excited to go ride in that perfect of a 1. As we went down the run, it was the same old usual every 1 1. so I talked to my friends 1 suggested that it was time we went through some new trails. They agreed, so we went down through 1 new area. It was a good trail with many jumps 1 a lot of powder. It seemed like a perfect area to board in. We all enjoyed it very much. But we realized that it was coming to the end when the trail was getting a little narrow, then suddenly, there was a drop right in front of us. I shifted my board sideways so I can stop, but it didn't help. It was a patch of ice that i hit, 1 it was no use. I couldn't stop. I fell off, 1 braced for impact. I was thinking that I was about to be seriously injured because of the rocks below. But luckily, my board was the first to hit the rock, showering the cool 1 with sparks lighting it up. I slid down the snow a couple more feet, trying to stop myself. As I came to a stop, I looked back wondering how I survived that. I was worried that my friends would do the same, but they had stopped just in time. We all couldn't believe on what just happened. I learned a lesson from 1 of to always scope out the area first before you go through it. I luckily was not hurt, I could have been seriously injured.

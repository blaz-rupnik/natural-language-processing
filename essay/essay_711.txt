        1         1 for my 1 birthday we went to 1 for a week, 16 was so much fun when we got there but the drive was not fun at all. When we got to the house that 1 is was so beautiful the snow was falling and 16 was coming down so hard 16 looked like white cotton balls and the snow on the house was just amazingly marvelous I mean 16 seriously looked like 16 could have belonged in a story book as a princess castle. When we got in the house 16 was really relaxed and nobody really wanted to do anything we all pretty much fell asleep on the couch. The next morning when we woke up we were all eating breakfast and watching the snow 2, there was a knock on the door, so of course I had to 9 get 16 because my 17 was "too tired" so i got up and went and opened the the door and three huge boys came in and picked me up now at first i was like "2 who are these boys?" but then after they took their hoods off i noticed 16 was my cousin 1, his best friend 2 and his other friend 3. So they carried me back to the table and sat me down and 16 was funny because my whole 17 was laughing so hard they couldn't breathe and i still had a horrified look on my face. They yelled"4" and then went out back and started building snow ramps to snowboard off of. So i got dressed and went out back with them and at first they were like "5 great she is out here". And they usually give me a lot of attention but they weren't so i decided i needed more attention so when they weren't looking i went and sat down and the snowboard ramp the had built and of course 2 knew why i was doing 16 but 3 and 1 were still clueless so of course they told me to get off but i told them "7" and that irritated them so 1 said "8 girl if you don't move i am going to jump over you", well of course i was super mad at this point and wanted to see if he would actually do 16 so i told him "9 ahead" 1 started to 9 but then 2 grabbed him,10 him off the snowboard and started yelling at him 11 the time the whole argument was over, witch 11 the way lasted almost the whole day. I went to bed 1 and 11 and 3 went to the bar and the next morning I was told to sleep in but i was woken up at seven o'clock 11 2 and 3 screaming at 1 to get up but they didn't get him up they got me up I was so mad I felt like a mama bear who just got woken up in the middle of hibernation. 16 was so irritating to be a house with three hungover twenty-one 1 old's but i had fun anyways, That 1 they were not home 14 god but with them not there is was peace and quiet so we played 15 and 3, 16 was so much fun we had a blast. The next morning wasn't all that fun because we had another 17, 18 us. I swear i was so irritated I wanted to pounce on them like and angry tiger getting ready to catch her prey. So i tried to stay away as much as possible, witch was kind of hard because they all love me but i just decided to lock myself in my room for the day to avoid them, 16 kind of sucked but 16 was a lot better than having them yell in my ear every five seconds. The day after we cleaned and started getting ready to leave, 16 was not fun at all but my 17 made sure i was cleaning and we ate three meals and after every meal we cleaned again but that 1 we went to bed and you didn't hear a peep out of anybody because we were so tired but the next morning we left at seven o'clock and started driving back to 2 16 was so fun being at 1 we have made 16 a tradition but we weren't able to 9 this 1 because of winter formal but we are definitely going back this 1 and we will have twice as much fun as we did two ears ago!

 To me laughter Is someone showing joy and excitement to the others around them. Laughter 1 some times be used In the wrong kind of way such as 1 someone where to get hurt In any kind of way the other person laughs at them when 2 hurt them. When I can make someone else laugh or giggle 2 not only makes me fill good but also the other person I was talking to. 2 shows both of us that we can be happy and that there Is joy 4 of us. I have a friend that I go to school with everyday and he always just looks so grumpy and or upset. And when someone asks him what Is wrong or 1 he Is okay 2 seems that he just gets more angry. So me being one of his closer friends I try and help him with that, and so far 2 has been working and I can make him happy by laughing and getting a big smile on his face. Every time I see him In the hall way or even out of school I will always say something to him to get him to smile and laugh. And by the way I show him I care and him knowing that I don't want him to be grumpy to others we have grew a bond and we seem to spend a lot more time together. And by him being In a better mood 2 makes his hole day of school lot funner and more enjoyable, and for all the others that are around him. 1 I were to explain who I was I would say that I am a very happy person and that I have respect for others and I express and show others that. Being happy brings joy to other people that are surrounding you witch usually leads to laughter. Laughter Is a very Important part of your daily life and I think that 2 brings people closer, so use 2 don't be afraid.

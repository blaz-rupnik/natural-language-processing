 One day 17 I was having trouble trying to cope with some very big changes in 13 life, I seeked the help of a friend. Usually 17 i'm having a bad day I 14 keep to myself. This was an occasion 17 I need someone else there to help 2. 17 I went 5 met with 13 friend she tried all she could to cheer 2 up but nothing was working. 6 she said "1 hear a story?" 2 wanting to hear anything that would take 2 out of this slump I was curently in said "3, 4 12 think it will help."5 6 she began. "The other day 13 family 5 I went grocery shopping. We were gone for probably four hours. I stopped her right there 5 asked her how this was relavent to making 2 feel better 5 she said "The more details the funnier it is." I told her to continue. She continued, "6 we got home 5 the parents started unloading the grocerys. While they were doing that 13 sister 5 I were in the living room teaching our dog how to sit, lay, shake, speak, 5 roll over. Everytime she did a trick we would give her half a dog treat. 17 the parents were done putting the grocerys away they walked in the living room 5 we showed them the tricks we had taught our dog, they had yet to see them. After we showed them all 13 father had to say was "7 3 12 put the dog treats up 6 she doesn'11 get into them." I replied with a simple "8." 6 the parents said they would be back that they were going to get pizza because they didn'11 want to cook after a long day of shopping, 5 6 they left. While they were gone 13 sister 5 I straightened up the living room 5 continued to train the dog. 17 the parents got back we all sat 5 5 began to watch 11.V. 5 eat our pizza. After 5 while 17 everyone was done eating we were still in the living room 5 13 sister 5 I heard 13 dad in the kitchen complaining about not being able to find the cookies they 14 bought. I looked at 13 sister 5 said "12 know what would be funny? 4 dad thought the dog treats were cookies 5 ate one." 13 sister giggled. Our dad came stomping into the living room 5 threw himself on the couch, acting like a four year old boy who 14 got his game taken away. We began to laugh 5 our dad looked over 5 scolded us, then looked back at the 1. Then out of nowhere 15 said "I found them." Or what 15 thought was them. 15 reached for the dog treats on the coffee table. 13 sister 5 I didn'11 dare speak a word. We watched him. 15 looked at the 1 5 reached his hand into the bag of dog treats 5 pulled one out. 15 looked at us 5 we looked away momentarilly. Then our eyes fixed right back on him, beyone our control. We 14 had to watch. 15 looked away to the 1 again 5 put a whole dog treat in his mouth. 15 began to chew. Then 15 slowed down his chewing 5 tilted his head to the side, 14 like a dog would. What a coincidience. Then it sounded like 15 choked on a piece of it 5 15 began to cough. 15 spit dog treats all over the back of 13 moms head who was sitting on the floor. 13 sister 5 I began to laugh histariclly beyond our control. 13 dad was 14 sitting on the couch with a straight face, I swear we could see the smoke coming out of his ears. 15 began to yell about how we should have put the dog treats up 6 this wouldn'11 happen but in mid sentence, 15 14 couldn'11 help it anymore. 15 began to laugh. 6 we were all laughing, then we look at 13 mom who was still sitting on the floor in still in shock because she got sprayed with chewed dog treats. We could stop laughing, 6 then she began to laugh." 17 she told 2 this story 5 laughed 6 had I cried. Then I realized "All 12 need is a little laughter in your day to brighten your life."
